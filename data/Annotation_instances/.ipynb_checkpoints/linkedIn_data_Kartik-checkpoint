As the chief storyteller for my organization, I take great pleasure in creating compelling, brand conscious content strategies to help my partners: generate leads, convert customers or increase awareness or engagement around their products and services. My ability to build authentic, digital narratives that capture market share and today's number one currency — attention — is not only extremely valuable for my executive partners, it's something I thoroughly enjoy. For me, strategic communications is fun as well as valuable. I welcome the opportunities I've enjoyed to work in tandem with leaders across verticals to convey a unified message inside and outside an organization. At the end of the day, no matter what form they take, communications should holistically advance a distinct brand that unifies an organization's mission, goals, aspirations, and talent.As a journalist, I've conducted thousands of interviews with leaders in almost every industry there is. As an editor I've led B2B magazine launches and produced celebrated monthly print and digital publications with tens of thousands of global readers. I know how to craft and package a compelling story, how to develop a message that will attract attention and how to use content to persuade someone to heed a call to action. And if things go astray, I know how to leverage those same tools to realign a damaged reputation and emerge stronger than ever.I've attracted tens of thousands of followers to my award-winning blog A Life Not Grey.

I wasn't a mosquito in the Kafkaesque sense—I didn’t wake up one morning to discover that I had become a gigantic insect, a stranger to myself and the world.

In an uncertain world, strong employee engagement will future-proof your company. Last year showed the business world how easily our goals, visions, and profitability can radically change. The way we work has changed. Forever. And that’s a good thing because it gives us an opportunity to re-engage with HOW and WHY our employees work. Consider this:• 72% of workers surveyed by the World Economic Forum want a hybrid remote-office model;• 64% of the U.S. workforce is disengaged;• 69% of employees are experiencing burnout symptoms while working from home; and• Almost 9 in 10 (89%) US workers have experienced burnout in the last yearYour team works from home now, in some capacity. And while your workforce may want a hybrid-office work model now and for the future, they are experiencing higher-than-ever levels of burnout. Burnout leads to disengagement, and disengaged workforces underperform. Now is the time to transition, support, empower, and inspire your employees to perform at a higher and happier level.Employee engagement must be your critical business objective if you want organizational agility, ongoing profitability and performance, customer satisfaction, and fulfilled team members.As a best-selling author, consultant, and coach for over 15 years, I have worked with organizations of all sizes around the world to improve the engagement and productivity of their teams and the efficacy of their leadership.

Our Twitter account, @mckinseychina, was named a ""Top 50 Finance Twitter Feed You Must Follow"" by the Wall Street Journal. I’ve helped several senior colleagues build social media followings in the hundreds of thousands and even millions. I pioneered our firm’s global presence on LinkedIn and advised several senior colleagues as they’ve built their followings into the hundreds of thousands.

Over a million people a month read my Inc.com column, and my work’s been published by TIME, Business Insider, and Forbes, among others. I'm also the author of ""EQ Applied: The Real-World Guide to Emotional Intelligence,"" which uses fascinating research, modern examples, and personal stories to illustrate what this quality looks like in the real world--and teaches you how to make emotions work for you, instead of against you.",2 years ago,"Everyone wants to be appreciated. But what if you're not in the habit of doling out praise or commendation? How can you show appreciation for others, while still keeping it real? You must follow two rules:  1. Be sincere. Attempts to flatter or compliment superficially will backfire in the long run. You also shouldn’t view commendation as a task to be checked off your list.  Rather, sincere praise comes from consistently looking for the good in others--then, pointing those things out. If you feel uncomfortable doing it in person, try writing a short note to start. 2. Be specific. There’s value in expressing general appreciation, but the more specific you are, the better. Don't just tell them they're great, tell them *what* they do great--and why you appreciate it. The truth is everyone deserves commendation for something. By learning to identify, recognize, and praise the gifts of others, you bring out the best in them.

In 2016 my friend asked to interview me about a new startup I was starting. I remember thinking to myself *OMG NO* because the thought of being on camera terrified me. For some reason, I agreed to do it anyway.It went terribly & I was so embarrassed. After that, I made a promise to myself to master the art of being on camera and ended up recording a video for +500 straight days. Eventually that lead me to LinkedIn, where I became one of the first video influencers. Long story short, my first company (a virtual reality startup) failed within months. My second company (an agency that focused on LinkedIn personal branding) found some success as I started to grow but ultimately was just me and I wanted more. My third company (video storytelling, personal branding, and signature experiences) found a lot of success before we decided to close down amidst Covid-19.There were a lot of ups & downs throughout 2016-2021:▶ Power being turned off.▶ Sleeping on my office floor.▶ Pushing myself to speak: TEDx talk, INBOUND, VidCon, and over 50 other events.▶ Launching a podcast that hit top 50 on day one — Stupid Deep.▶ Building a company with some of my best friends — and being able to employ 10 others full-time.▶ And I could go on and on and on.My little brother passed away in 2019. Going through that, COVID, and everything else going on in our world I knew that I needed something new. I interviewed Lewis Howes on my podcast. A handful of months later I joined his team at Greatness Media as the marketing lead. That’s where I’m at now and I’m enjoying every second of it. Collectively my videos, thoughts, podcasts, and writing have been viewed over 15 million times.How I can help you:✔️ Podcast Sponsorship: My show Stupid Deep is a cinematic podcast. It’s grown quickly and I’m not slowing down anytime soon.✔️ Personal Branding consulting: Growth, strategy, LinkedIn, content strategy, etc. I only work with 10 personal branding clients a year. 😊✔️ Speaking at your event: I’ve done talks at INBOUND, VidCon, TEDx, and more.✔️ Esports — one of my main passions is esports (and just gaming overall). I will be helping endemic & non-endemic brands via connections, sponsorships, and branding/personal branding.Feel free to reach out to me here, via email, or you can learn more about me on my website: quentinallums.com",2 years ago,"This is just so incredibly humbling.

Most of my time is now spent building businesses that will make a positive difference in the world and working with Virgin Unite and organisations it has incubated, such as The Elders, The Carbon War Room, The B Team and Ocean Unite. I also serve on the Global Commission on Drug Policy and supports ocean conservation with the Ocean Elders.

E.g. dermatology versus internal medicine. On the other, I sort them out based on whether they’re more interaction-based or data-based. E.g. psychiatry versus radiology. I then inserted the different professions into this matrix and checked what kind of future awaits each.  Naturally, they all get impacted differently, and here I’m focusing on the impact and not the categories.  Inserting these professions into the matrix was my subjective choice.

Stop outs, drop outs, high school grads that never went to college, Veterans, workers retooling it improving, seniors, women with children — non trads of all sorts who are becoming trads..... A small non-elite college needs to reframe who its students are and how to serve them well — very well.  Why would non-elite colleges try to get “better” high school grads when that will never work near or longer term?.  Think boldly, innovatively about new populations to serve.  Goodness, bring anchored in old ways is doomed.  Realize that way ahead of 2026; realize it three years ago and had this been done successfully, more than a handful of  small colleges would not have closed. And if stuck in past, don’t lead in US.  Go to another nation that has different demographics and do more of same.  Of course, absence of innovation anywhere in the globe is fatal. Demographics aren’t only driver for education!!!

Well done!! Nine years ago, I remember having a conversation with a (now-departed) Microsoft executive about the future of Windows Phone. My take was that we would be better off monetizing Office for Mac and Android by making it available on the hundreds of millions of devices already being sold. I distinctly remember saying: ""We already own the office productivity market for Desktop, this is the easiest way to win in Mobile - right now. We can fight the hardware battle another day."" Emphatically, I was told that I was wrong, without any data to back up that assertion, other than, and I quote: ""We will kill the iPhone.""  Years later, $40+ billion wasted on Nokia, many lessons learned, we now have this: ""But Microsoft has assured CNET that it's sticking with Android and has no plans to make a Windows-based phone. The company's Chief Product Officer Panos Panay was so emphatic about that fact, he told Wired so -- twice"" What a tremendous cultural change by Microsoft. Where Steve Ballmer and many of his former leaders fanatically pushed a dying idea to the brink of despair, Satya Nadella smartly monetized Office, embraced the world's biggest phone OS, and quietly beat everyone to innovation. This is how you win.

In 2016 my friend asked to interview me about a new startup I was starting. I remember thinking to myself *OMG NO* because the thought of being on camera terrified me. For some reason, I agreed to do it anyway.It went terribly & I was so embarrassed. After that, I made a promise to myself to master the art of being on camera and ended up recording a video for +500 straight days. Eventually that lead me to LinkedIn, where I became one of the first video influencers. Long story short, my first company (a virtual reality startup) failed within months. My second company (an agency that focused on LinkedIn personal branding) found some success as I started to grow but ultimately was just me and I wanted more. My third company (video storytelling, personal branding, and signature experiences) found a lot of success before we decided to close down amidst Covid-19.There were a lot of ups & downs throughout 2016-2021:▶ Power being turned off.▶ Sleeping on my office floor.▶ Pushing myself to speak: TEDx talk, INBOUND, VidCon, and over 50 other events.▶ Launching a podcast that hit top 50 on day one — Stupid Deep.▶ Building a company with some of my best friends — and being able to employ 10 others full-time.▶ And I could go on and on and on.My little brother passed away in 2019. Going through that, COVID, and everything else going on in our world I knew that I needed something new. I interviewed Lewis Howes on my podcast. A handful of months later I joined his team at Greatness Media as the marketing lead. That’s where I’m at now and I’m enjoying every second of it. Collectively my videos, thoughts, podcasts, and writing have been viewed over 15 million times.How I can help you:✔️ Podcast Sponsorship: My show Stupid Deep is a cinematic podcast. It’s grown quickly and I’m not slowing down anytime soon.✔️ Personal Branding consulting: Growth, strategy, LinkedIn, content strategy, etc. I only work with 10 personal branding clients a year. 😊✔️ Speaking at your event: I’ve done talks at INBOUND, VidCon, TEDx, and more.✔️ Esports — one of my main passions is esports (and just gaming overall).

We want people that we can grow with. - He made a video telling us why he'd be a good fit. - He didn't wait around for me to answer, he put in the work on his own and had something to show when we finally sat down. - And since bringing him on he's made us so much better, more creative, and so much more organized as a company.

In an uncertain world, strong employee engagement will future-proof your company. Last year showed the business world how easily our goals, visions, and profitability can radically change. The way we work has changed. Forever. And that’s a good thing because it gives us an opportunity to re-engage with HOW and WHY our employees work. Consider this:• 72% of workers surveyed by the World Economic Forum want a hybrid remote-office model;• 64% of the U.S. workforce is disengaged;• 69% of employees are experiencing burnout symptoms while working from home; and• Almost 9 in 10 (89%) US workers have experienced burnout in the last yearYour team works from home now, in some capacity. And while your workforce may want a hybrid-office work model now and for the future, they are experiencing higher-than-ever levels of burnout. Burnout leads to disengagement, and disengaged workforces underperform. Now is the time to transition, support, empower, and inspire your employees to perform at a higher and happier level.Employee engagement must be your critical business objective if you want organizational agility, ongoing profitability and performance, customer satisfaction, and fulfilled team members.As a best-selling author, consultant, and coach for over 15 years, I have worked with organizations of all sizes around the world to improve the engagement and productivity of their teams and the efficacy of their leadership. I equip, empower, and inspire them to:• Develop their managers as both engagers of their people and keepers of the culture • Address remote culture breakdowns and “death by Zoom”• Elevate performance and productivity to work smarter in a remote world• Connect individual contributors to organizational goals and hold them accountable for results• Empower their managers to lead agile, high-performance, hybrid teams• Streamline communication channel overwhelm and tame their inboxMy clients have had these results…$2 million in additional revenue per year• ""Our total sales calls per week are up over 20% from the prior year.

From his basement, he launched SoftKey Software Products. As sales took off, Kevin moved to headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts and went on an industry consolidating acquisition binge.From 1995 to 1999 he bought out almost every one of his software competitors, including Mindscape, Broderbund and the Learning Company in the industry's first vicious public hostile battle. Shareholders loved his take-no-prisoners, cost cutting style and fueled him with billions to do his deals.In 1999 Kevin sold his company to the Mattel Toy Company for $4.2 billion, one of the largest deals ever done in the consumer software industry. To keep his money working hard, he took control of his wealth from his lackluster money managers and founded his own mutual fund company, O'Leary Funds. He raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors who share his ""get paid while you wait"" yield oriented, value investing philosophy. He shares his tips and tribulations with a national television audience and turns The Street upside down in the process.As a self-proclaimed ""Eco-preneur,"" Kevin looks hardest for investments that make money - and are environmentally friendly. When he's not squeezing the market from his office, he travels the world looking for new opportunities to deploy his capital.

In an uncertain world, strong employee engagement will future-proof your company. Last year showed the business world how easily our goals, visions, and profitability can radically change. The way we work has changed. Forever. And that’s a good thing because it gives us an opportunity to re-engage with HOW and WHY our employees work. Consider this:• 72% of workers surveyed by the World Economic Forum want a hybrid remote-office model;• 64% of the U.S. workforce is disengaged;• 69% of employees are experiencing burnout symptoms while working from home; and• Almost 9 in 10 (89%) US workers have experienced burnout in the last yearYour team works from home now, in some capacity. And while your workforce may want a hybrid-office work model now and for the future, they are experiencing higher-than-ever levels of burnout. Burnout leads to disengagement, and disengaged workforces underperform. Now is the time to transition, support, empower, and inspire your employees to perform at a higher and happier level.Employee engagement must be your critical business objective if you want organizational agility, ongoing profitability and performance, customer satisfaction, and fulfilled team members.As a best-selling author, consultant, and coach for over 15 years, I have worked with organizations of all sizes around the world to improve the engagement and productivity of their teams and the efficacy of their leadership. I equip, empower, and inspire them to:• Develop their managers as both engagers of their people and keepers of the culture • Address remote culture breakdowns and “death by Zoom”• Elevate performance and productivity to work smarter in a remote world• Connect individual contributors to organizational goals and hold them accountable for results• Empower their managers to lead agile, high-performance, hybrid teams• Streamline communication channel overwhelm and tame their inboxMy clients have had these results…$2 million in additional revenue per year• ""Our total sales calls per week are up over 20% from the prior year.

So what’s the best way to move past being mad or irritated or depressed during a period of injury or illness? Step one. Accept the current reality of the situation. Step two? Reframe the situation—For example if you are ‘bummed out’ you can’t play tennis for three months, think  ‘now an opportunity to read those books I’ve been wanting to read’ or to ‘learn to cook those four dishes that I’ve  just haven’t gotten around to...’ Truth is there’s lots that can be done during this ‘down time,’ so think ‘Crisis as Opportunity.’

Consider this:• 72% of workers surveyed by the World Economic Forum want a hybrid remote-office model;• 64% of the U.S. workforce is disengaged;• 69% of employees are experiencing burnout symptoms while working from home; and• Almost 9 in 10 (89%) US workers have experienced burnout in the last yearYour team works from home now, in some capacity. And while your workforce may want a hybrid-office work model now and for the future, they are experiencing higher-than-ever levels of burnout. Burnout leads to disengagement, and disengaged workforces underperform. Now is the time to transition, support, empower, and inspire your employees to perform at a higher and happier level.Employee engagement must be your critical business objective if you want organizational agility, ongoing profitability and performance, customer satisfaction, and fulfilled team members.As a best-selling author, consultant, and coach for over 15 years, I have worked with organizations of all sizes around the world to improve the engagement and productivity of their teams and the efficacy of their leadership. I equip, empower, and inspire them to:• Develop their managers as both engagers of their people and keepers of the culture • Address remote culture breakdowns and “death by Zoom”• Elevate performance and productivity to work smarter in a remote world• Connect individual contributors to organizational goals and hold them accountable for results• Empower their managers to lead agile, high-performance, hybrid teams• Streamline communication channel overwhelm and tame their inboxMy clients have had these results…$2 million in additional revenue per year• ""Our total sales calls per week are up over 20% from the prior year.

This book is English/Spanish.  And, it has other key features: it is on indestructible paper so it can be used by several classes and wiped clean and with very young children (sort of like cloth books in my era or board books but better); it is a book that can and should be read and re-read and it works in a circle in a sense, playing hide and seek again and again.  It has tips for adult readers to enable them to enhance the reading with their children/students/ friends/relatives. Finally, it deals with object constancy, something of critical importance to children who struggle with trauma.  It is a book for the holidays and thereafter.  Enjoy and learn and play.

32025,Quentin Michael Allums,Marketing @ Greatness Media. TEDx Speaker. Podcaster. Writer. Esports Geek. DM me for more info on podcast sponsorship or personal branding ⤵️,"['Milwaukee,', 'Wisconsin,', 'United', 'States']",66387.0,500+,"Hey, I'm #justQ 🖖🏽! In 2016 my friend asked to interview me about a new startup I was starting. I remember thinking to myself *OMG NO* because the thought of being on camera terrified me. For some reason, I agreed to do it anyway.It went terribly & I was so embarrassed. After that, I made a promise to myself to master the art of being on camera and ended up recording a video for +500 straight days. Eventually that lead me to LinkedIn, where I became one of the first video influencers. Long story short, my first company (a virtual reality startup) failed within months. My second company (an agency that focused on LinkedIn personal branding) found some success as I started to grow but ultimately was just me and I wanted more. My third company (video storytelling, personal branding, and signature experiences) found a lot of success before we decided to close down amidst Covid-19.There were a lot of ups & downs throughout 2016-2021:▶ Power being turned off.▶ Sleeping on my office floor.▶ Pushing myself to speak: TEDx talk, INBOUND, VidCon, and over 50 other events.▶ Launching a podcast that hit top 50 on day one — Stupid Deep.▶ Building a company with some of my best friends — and being able to employ 10 others full-time.▶ And I could go on and on and on.My little brother passed away in 2019. Going through that, COVID, and everything else going on in our world I knew that I needed something new. I interviewed Lewis Howes on my podcast. A handful of months later I joined his team at Greatness Media as the marketing lead. That’s where I’m at now and I’m enjoying every second of it. Collectively my videos, thoughts, podcasts, and writing have been viewed over 15 million times.How I can help you:✔️ Podcast Sponsorship: My show Stupid Deep is a cinematic podcast. It’s grown quickly and I’m not slowing down anytime soon.✔️ Personal Branding consulting: Growth, strategy, LinkedIn, content strategy, etc. I only work with 10 personal branding clients a year. 😊✔️ Speaking at your event: I’ve done talks at INBOUND, VidCon, TEDx, and more.✔️ Esports — one of my main passions is esports (and just gaming overall). I will be helping endemic & non-endemic brands via connections, sponsorships, and branding/personal branding.Feel free to reach out to me here, via email, or you can learn more about me on my website: quentinallums.com",7 months ago,"For me, 2016- (the start of) 2020 was an epic story: ✅ Quit my full-time job to start a company. ✅ First company failed. Burned through funds, had to rent out my extra rooms just to pay rent, power was turned off a few times. ✅ Recorded videos documenting my thought process through everything. ✅ Eventually people took notice of my videos. I helped a lot of people grow in the same way that I did. ✅ I was homeless for a handful of months. Slept on my office floor. Sometimes Airbnb's or hotels.  ✅ Launched a new company with a friend and two semi-strangers and we grew really quickly. Made a lot of mistakes. Make a lot of good decisions too.  ✅ Spoke on stages like VidCon, TEDx, and INBOUND. ✅ I can now be tied back to the inception of a lot of LinkedIn influencers. This year has not been ideal. It wasn't a part of my plan. At the beginning of the year I felt like I was about to jump on a launch pad into a new universe. Now it feels like the next chapter... maybe even a new book.  The more we linger on the old bullet points, the more we keep ourselves from creating new ones. I don't entirely know what the next chapter looks like. But I know it's going to be a good story. And that's all we really are anyway — stories. ""Let's just make it a good one, eh?"" #justQ  🖖🏽🖤

Paywalls are an anathema for journalists -- they for cut you off from the Internet's greatest gift -- access to global distribution for free. The Second Law of Online Media states: Content is infinitely scalable. Others will carry it and evangelize it. But that won't happen with a paywall.  Google and Facebook don't have paywalls -- yet they advise newspaper and magazine publishers to build paywalls(!) which means that the publishers cut themselves off from the single best thing about the Internet -- instant distribution at global scale.

32141,Quentin Michael Allums,Marketing @ Greatness Media. TEDx Speaker. Podcaster. Writer. Esports Geek. DM me for more info on podcast sponsorship or personal branding ⤵️,"['Milwaukee,', 'Wisconsin,', 'United', 'States']",66387.0,500+,"Hey, I'm #justQ 🖖🏽! In 2016 my friend asked to interview me about a new startup I was starting. I remember thinking to myself *OMG NO* because the thought of being on camera terrified me. For some reason, I agreed to do it anyway.It went terribly & I was so embarrassed. After that, I made a promise to myself to master the art of being on camera and ended up recording a video for +500 straight days. Eventually that lead me to LinkedIn, where I became one of the first video influencers. Long story short, my first company (a virtual reality startup) failed within months. My second company (an agency that focused on LinkedIn personal branding) found some success as I started to grow but ultimately was just me and I wanted more. My third company (video storytelling, personal branding, and signature experiences) found a lot of success before we decided to close down amidst Covid-19.There were a lot of ups & downs throughout 2016-2021:▶ Power being turned off.▶ Sleeping on my office floor.▶ Pushing myself to speak: TEDx talk, INBOUND, VidCon, and over 50 other events.▶ Launching a podcast that hit top 50 on day one — Stupid Deep.▶ Building a company with some of my best friends — and being able to employ 10 others full-time.▶ And I could go on and on and on.My little brother passed away in 2019. Going through that, COVID, and everything else going on in our world I knew that I needed something new. I interviewed Lewis Howes on my podcast. A handful of months later I joined his team at Greatness Media as the marketing lead. That’s where I’m at now and I’m enjoying every second of it. Collectively my videos, thoughts, podcasts, and writing have been viewed over 15 million times.How I can help you:✔️ Podcast Sponsorship: My show Stupid Deep is a cinematic podcast. It’s grown quickly and I’m not slowing down anytime soon.✔️ Personal Branding consulting: Growth, strategy, LinkedIn, content strategy, etc. I only work with 10 personal branding clients a year. 😊✔️ Speaking at your event: I’ve done talks at INBOUND, VidCon, TEDx, and more.✔️ Esports — one of my main passions is esports (and just gaming overall). I will be helping endemic & non-endemic brands via connections, sponsorships, and branding/personal branding.Feel free to reach out to me here, via email, or you can learn more about me on my website: quentinallums.com",1 year ago,"My TEDx was about standing out with a story. And there are few things that illustrate the power of story better than this.👇🏽 In the 60s a Harvard Psychologist, Robert Rosenthal, approached a school in California. Basically saying, “hey, I have this test I can give your students to help you identify which students are special.” The kids were then separated into two groups “average” and “special”. A year went by and the test was incredibly accurate. The “special” group blew the other group out of the water in everything from: test scores, curiosity, happiness, etc. Even the teachers were happier. The thing is, that test was 100% bullshit and the students were chosen at random.  So 1). A good story can help sell anything. And 2). Pay attention to the narratives that you’re telling yourself. Because stories have the power to create reality. #justQ  🖖🏽🖤  #entrepreneurship   #PublicSpeaking

I wonder what my peers will complain about when patients start using artificial intelligence-based tools that are available online. An excerpt from the book: ""The fact that my lymphoma had affacted over twenty sites, had spread above and below my diaphragm, and had entered an organ outside the lymphatic system meant that I was automatically categorized as a stage IV patient. But what I didn't know at the time of diagnosis was that this crude method of staging has more to do with what medical students can memorize than what modern medicine can cure.  In the depths of my own research, I found a research paper that did quantify the predictive power of these alternate metrics."" #themedicalfuturist   #digitalhealth   #future   #healthcare   #medicine   #technology   #AI   #artificialintelligence   #chess   #deeplearning   #machinelearning   #TMFchessjourney

As a lazy teenager, I desperately joined the wrestling team and never won a match. As an adult, I have tried to prioritize fitness many times, but have failed at each attempt. This was until I found Fitbod, a great app that has helped me consistently go to the gym for over two years. Beautifully designed and with over 3M downloads, it is among the highest grossing and highest rated apps on the Apple App Store. Fitbod has been more than useful to me, but I was surprised to learn that my book, Hooked, was useful to their founders. Fitbod is  Allen Chen 's brainchild and he told me that he designed the initial prototype based on the four parts of the Hooked Model. He identified the internal trigger as not knowing what to do at the gym. Check out the link ⇒  http://bit.ly/2WsOuPM #Hooked   #InternalTrigger   #Indistractable   #Fitness   #Fitbod

In an uncertain world, strong employee engagement will future-proof your company. Last year showed the business world how easily our goals, visions, and profitability can radically change. The way we work has changed. Forever. And that’s a good thing because it gives us an opportunity to re-engage with HOW and WHY our employees work. Consider this:• 72% of workers surveyed by the World Economic Forum want a hybrid remote-office model;• 64% of the U.S. workforce is disengaged;• 69% of employees are experiencing burnout symptoms while working from home; and• Almost 9 in 10 (89%) US workers have experienced burnout in the last yearYour team works from home now, in some capacity. And while your workforce may want a hybrid-office work model now and for the future, they are experiencing higher-than-ever levels of burnout.

Health Insurance CEOs earned between 300 - 600 times more than the ‘regular’ employee. All major insurance companies paid their CEOs over 20Million dollars this year. Insurance companies collected a whopping $22Billion in profit—that’s profit—to be spent on executive bonuses. And let me remind you that those dollars started out as part of your salaries, which got withheld from your employer to cover these big profits. Got an issue with health insurance coverage being so darn expensive? Then I suggest you look at those private insurance companies raking in all your hard-earned money and start asking the hard question: ‘Why should they charge me such high rates if my money is not going towards health care for me and my family but instead being used to pay executives millions of dollars each year?’ And once you hear nothing from your insurance company then you might think differently about other ways we could be using our hard-earned dollars to benefit ourselves instead of benefiting some CEO. Selected Excerpt: “Combined, the CEOs of the eight largest publicly traded insurance companies, including pharmacy behemoth CVS, which acquired insurer Aetna, made $143.5 million in total compensation in 2018, up 14.4%.”

In an uncertain world, strong employee engagement will future-proof your company. Last year showed the business world how easily our goals, visions, and profitability can radically change. The way we work has changed. Forever. And that’s a good thing because it gives us an opportunity to re-engage with HOW and WHY our employees work. Consider this:• 72% of workers surveyed by the World Economic Forum want a hybrid remote-office model;• 64% of the U.S. workforce is disengaged;• 69% of employees are experiencing burnout symptoms while working from home; and• Almost 9 in 10 (89%) US workers have experienced burnout in the last yearYour team works from home now, in some capacity. And while your workforce may want a hybrid-office work model now and for the future, they are experiencing higher-than-ever levels of burnout. Burnout leads to disengagement, and disengaged workforces underperform. Now is the time to transition, support, empower, and inspire your employees to perform at a higher and happier level.Employee engagement must be your critical business objective if you want organizational agility, ongoing profitability and performance, customer satisfaction, and fulfilled team members.As a best-selling author, consultant, and coach for over 15 years, I have worked with organizations of all sizes around the world to improve the engagement and productivity of their teams and the efficacy of their leadership. I equip, empower, and inspire them to:• Develop their managers as both engagers of their people and keepers of the culture • Address remote culture breakdowns and “death by Zoom”• Elevate performance and productivity to work smarter in a remote world• Connect individual contributors to organizational goals and hold them accountable for results• Empower their managers to lead agile, high-performance, hybrid teams• Streamline communication channel overwhelm and tame their inboxMy clients have had these results…$2 million in additional revenue per year• ""Our total sales calls per week are up over 20% from the prior year.

In an uncertain world, strong employee engagement will future-proof your company. Last year showed the business world how easily our goals, visions, and profitability can radically change. The way we work has changed. Forever. And that’s a good thing because it gives us an opportunity to re-engage with HOW and WHY our employees work. Consider this:• 72% of workers surveyed by the World Economic Forum want a hybrid remote-office model;• 64% of the U.S. workforce is disengaged;• 69% of employees are experiencing burnout symptoms while working from home; and• Almost 9 in 10 (89%) US workers have experienced burnout in the last yearYour team works from home now, in some capacity. And while your workforce may want a hybrid-office work model now and for the future, they are experiencing higher-than-ever levels of burnout. Burnout leads to disengagement, and disengaged workforces underperform. Now is the time to transition, support, empower, and inspire your employees to perform at a higher and happier level.Employee engagement must be your critical business objective if you want organizational agility, ongoing profitability and performance, customer satisfaction, and fulfilled team members.As a best-selling author, consultant, and coach for over 15 years, I have worked with organizations of all sizes around the world to improve the engagement and productivity of their teams and the efficacy of their leadership. I equip, empower, and inspire them to:• Develop their managers as both engagers of their people and keepers of the culture • Address remote culture breakdowns and “death by Zoom”• Elevate performance and productivity to work smarter in a remote world• Connect individual contributors to organizational goals and hold them accountable for results• Empower their managers to lead agile, high-performance, hybrid teams• Streamline communication channel overwhelm and tame their inboxMy clients have had these results…$2 million in additional revenue per year• ""Our total sales calls per week are up over 20% from the prior year.

Making a positive, life-changing decision requires three steps for success: 1. Awareness When we’re unhappy, it can often feel like there’s no way out, but you always have options. The first step in making a  #choice  is the  #awareness  that you have one. At this stage, it’s not about editing yourself on what’s possible; it’s about being mindful that change starts with you and your attitude. (Note: choosing not to make a change is also a choice; if you’re not changing it, you’re choosing it.) 2. Attention with Intention Once you’ve realized that change is an internal job, consider those things within your control and how they impact—for better or worse—what you want. Bring your  #attention  to your  #intention , and ask yourself what’s the one thing you can do right now to bring you closer to your  #goals . This need not be a grandiose, sweeping gesture; the biggest change starts with a small step in a new direction. 3. Action This last step may seem obvious, but far too often, we fail to act even when we know that making a change is in our best interest. Nothing changes if nothing changes. And action begets more action, giving us the much-needed momentum to keep going, no matter how slowly we start. #leadership   #career

In an uncertain world, strong employee engagement will future-proof your company. Last year showed the business world how easily our goals, visions, and profitability can radically change. The way we work has changed. Forever. And that’s a good thing because it gives us an opportunity to re-engage with HOW and WHY our employees work. Consider this:• 72% of workers surveyed by the World Economic Forum want a hybrid remote-office model;• 64% of the U.S. workforce is disengaged;• 69% of employees are experiencing burnout symptoms while working from home; and• Almost 9 in 10 (89%) US workers have experienced burnout in the last yearYour team works from home now, in some capacity. And while your workforce may want a hybrid-office work model now and for the future, they are experiencing higher-than-ever levels of burnout.

After already committing to this engagement, I had to do something... So I hired a consultant to master the art of delivery and combat imposter syndrome.  What an impact we made!!! Jacy ""I-milk-cows-on-skis"" Imilkowski (she/her)  is IN-CRED-I-BLE! If you feel weak in one area, ask for help. Hire a professional or reach out to a mentor. What are you working on? Are you learning from the pros? Thank you  Susan Young ,  Cheri Neal  and  Roger Wolkoff  at the  National Speakers Association  for bringing me in to talk about the new era of social media!  #professionalgrowth   #education   #socialmedia   #chantelshares

I've been working as a journalist and media trainer/advisor for the last 20+ years in the US and Africa, for companies including The Detroit Free Press, National Public Radio, Internews, the International Center for Journalists and Kenya’s Nation Media Group. During those years, I've produced news and analysis content on topics including child and reproductive health, international development policy, gender, sustainability and social justice. In both 2015 and 2016, I was recognized as one of LinkedIn's Top 10 Media Writers. Over the past year, I have produced feature stories on maternal mortality for National Geographic magazine, for their 2019 Global Health issue, and an update on the Ebola outbreak response in the Democratic Republic of Congo, for NatGeo Digital. Previous assignments included media outreach for the Uniting to Combat Neglected Tropical Diseases Coalition and for Malaria Must Die UK. I am also a media advisor for the Aspen Institute's Healthy Communities Fellowship, and served as a moderator during the 2019 Aspen Ideas Health Festival.My goal is to continue working with organizations involved in the global health realm by utilizing my decade-long experience mentoring journalists and providing communications consulting services to organizations throughout the U.S. and East Africa. I'm also available to provide strategic communications support in the form of logistics and media outreach for events.

This young mother, community activist and  #reproductivejustice  warrior was weaving a quilt of  #maternalhealth ,  #perinatalsupport ,  #compassion ,  #socialjustice  in her community, a town that exploded onto the world stage after the August 2014 police-related shooting death of Michael Brown. Brown's death ignited the already boiling cauldron of race in America and elevated conversations about inequity across a broad range of topics. Through my reporting on  #maternalmortality  and  #AfricanAmerican  women for @National Geographic, I met many amazing women like Tru Kellman. So it's exciting for me to see her work elevated as it was this morning on the  NBC News   #TodayShow .

In an uncertain world, strong employee engagement will future-proof your company. Last year showed the business world how easily our goals, visions, and profitability can radically change. The way we work has changed. Forever. And that’s a good thing because it gives us an opportunity to re-engage with HOW and WHY our employees work. Consider this:• 72% of workers surveyed by the World Economic Forum want a hybrid remote-office model;• 64% of the U.S. workforce is disengaged;• 69% of employees are experiencing burnout symptoms while working from home; and• Almost 9 in 10 (89%) US workers have experienced burnout in the last yearYour team works from home now, in some capacity. And while your workforce may want a hybrid-office work model now and for the future, they are experiencing higher-than-ever levels of burnout. Burnout leads to disengagement, and disengaged workforces underperform. Now is the time to transition, support, empower, and inspire your employees to perform at a higher and happier level.Employee engagement must be your critical business objective if you want organizational agility, ongoing profitability and performance, customer satisfaction, and fulfilled team members.As a best-selling author, consultant, and coach for over 15 years, I have worked with organizations of all sizes around the world to improve the engagement and productivity of their teams and the efficacy of their leadership. I equip, empower, and inspire them to:• Develop their managers as both engagers of their people and keepers of the culture • Address remote culture breakdowns and “death by Zoom”• Elevate performance and productivity to work smarter in a remote world• Connect individual contributors to organizational goals and hold them accountable for results• Empower their managers to lead agile, high-performance, hybrid teams• Streamline communication channel overwhelm and tame their inboxMy clients have had these results…$2 million in additional revenue per year• ""Our total sales calls per week are up over 20% from the prior year.

I believe the foundation of a good life is adequate sleep, physical activity (both moderate and intense), reflection, and connection, hence my mantra: sleep, step, sweat, reflect and connect.If you were to interrogate me at a party, I would tell you that when I was 9 years old I was a mosquito. I wasn't a mosquito in the Kafkaesque sense—I didn’t wake up one morning to discover that I had become a gigantic insect, a stranger to myself and the world. I was simply a mosquito in a skating show. It was a role that combined mild athleticism, music, and silly performance—these are the things that light me up.",8 months ago,"""Strength may be even more fundamental to our well-being than we already expect, since gaining it involves and alters some of the most ancient components of our central nervous system."" - Gretchen Reynolds",[],article,['https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/well/move/how-we-get-stronger.html'],0,0,[],7,0,,,,,

In an uncertain world, strong employee engagement will future-proof your company. Last year showed the business world how easily our goals, visions, and profitability can radically change. The way we work has changed. Forever. And that’s a good thing because it gives us an opportunity to re-engage with HOW and WHY our employees work. Consider this:• 72% of workers surveyed by the World Economic Forum want a hybrid remote-office model;• 64% of the U.S. workforce is disengaged;• 69% of employees are experiencing burnout symptoms while working from home; and• Almost 9 in 10 (89%) US workers have experienced burnout in the last yearYour team works from home now, in some capacity. And while your workforce may want a hybrid-office work model now and for the future, they are experiencing higher-than-ever levels of burnout. Burnout leads to disengagement, and disengaged workforces underperform. Now is the time to transition, support, empower, and inspire your employees to perform at a higher and happier level.Employee engagement must be your critical business objective if you want organizational agility, ongoing profitability and performance, customer satisfaction, and fulfilled team members.As a best-selling author, consultant, and coach for over 15 years, I have worked with organizations of all sizes around the world to improve the engagement and productivity of their teams and the efficacy of their leadership. I equip, empower, and inspire them to:• Develop their managers as both engagers of their people and keepers of the culture • Address remote culture breakdowns and “death by Zoom”• Elevate performance and productivity to work smarter in a remote world• Connect individual contributors to organizational goals and hold them accountable for results• Empower their managers to lead agile, high-performance, hybrid teams• Streamline communication channel overwhelm and tame their inboxMy clients have had these results…$2 million in additional revenue per year• ""Our total sales calls per week are up over 20% from the prior year.

Shareholders loved his take-no-prisoners, cost cutting style and fueled him with billions to do his deals.In 1999 Kevin sold his company to the Mattel Toy Company for $4.2 billion, one of the largest deals ever done in the consumer software industry. To keep his money working hard, he took control of his wealth from his lackluster money managers and founded his own mutual fund company, O'Leary Funds. He raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors who share his ""get paid while you wait"" yield oriented, value investing philosophy. He shares his tips and tribulations with a national television audience and turns The Street upside down in the process.As a self-proclaimed ""Eco-preneur,"" Kevin looks hardest for investments that make money - and are environmentally friendly.

Shareholders loved his take-no-prisoners, cost cutting style and fueled him with billions to do his deals.In 1999 Kevin sold his company to the Mattel Toy Company for $4.2 billion, one of the largest deals ever done in the consumer software industry. To keep his money working hard, he took control of his wealth from his lackluster money managers and founded his own mutual fund company, O'Leary Funds.

In an uncertain world, strong employee engagement will future-proof your company. Last year showed the business world how easily our goals, visions, and profitability can radically change. The way we work has changed. Forever. And that’s a good thing because it gives us an opportunity to re-engage with HOW and WHY our employees work. Consider this:• 72% of workers surveyed by the World Economic Forum want a hybrid remote-office model;• 64% of the U.S. workforce is disengaged;• 69% of employees are experiencing burnout symptoms while working from home; and• Almost 9 in 10 (89%) US workers have experienced burnout in the last yearYour team works from home now, in some capacity. And while your workforce may want a hybrid-office work model now and for the future, they are experiencing higher-than-ever levels of burnout. Burnout leads to disengagement, and disengaged workforces underperform. Now is the time to transition, support, empower, and inspire your employees to perform at a higher and happier level.Employee engagement must be your critical business objective if you want organizational agility, ongoing profitability and performance, customer satisfaction, and fulfilled team members.As a best-selling author, consultant, and coach for over 15 years, I have worked with organizations of all sizes around the world to improve the engagement and productivity of their teams and the efficacy of their leadership. I equip, empower, and inspire them to:• Develop their managers as both engagers of their people and keepers of the culture • Address remote culture breakdowns and “death by Zoom”• Elevate performance and productivity to work smarter in a remote world• Connect individual contributors to organizational goals and hold them accountable for results• Empower their managers to lead agile, high-performance, hybrid teams• Streamline communication channel overwhelm and tame their inboxMy clients have had these results…$2 million in additional revenue per year• ""Our total sales calls per week are up over 20% from the prior year.

DM me for more info on podcast sponsorship or personal branding ⤵️,"['Milwaukee,', 'Wisconsin,', 'United', 'States']",66387.0,500+,"Hey, I'm #justQ 🖖🏽! In 2016 my friend asked to interview me about a new startup I was starting. I remember thinking to myself *OMG NO* because the thought of being on camera terrified me. For some reason, I agreed to do it anyway.It went terribly & I was so embarrassed. After that, I made a promise to myself to master the art of being on camera and ended up recording a video for +500 straight days. Eventually that lead me to LinkedIn, where I became one of the first video influencers. Long story short, my first company (a virtual reality startup) failed within months. My second company (an agency that focused on LinkedIn personal branding) found some success as I started to grow but ultimately was just me and I wanted more. My third company (video storytelling, personal branding, and signature experiences) found a lot of success before we decided to close down amidst Covid-19.There were a lot of ups & downs throughout 2016-2021:▶ Power being turned off.▶ Sleeping on my office floor.▶ Pushing myself to speak: TEDx talk, INBOUND, VidCon, and over 50 other events.▶ Launching a podcast that hit top 50 on day one — Stupid Deep.▶ Building a company with some of my best friends — and being able to employ 10 others full-time.▶ And I could go on and on and on.My little brother passed away in 2019. Going through that, COVID, and everything else going on in our world I knew that I needed something new. I interviewed Lewis Howes on my podcast. A handful of months later I joined his team at Greatness Media as the marketing lead. That’s where I’m at now and I’m enjoying every second of it. Collectively my videos, thoughts, podcasts, and writing have been viewed over 15 million times.How I can help you:✔️ Podcast Sponsorship: My show Stupid Deep is a cinematic podcast. It’s grown quickly and I’m not slowing down anytime soon.✔️ Personal Branding consulting: Growth, strategy, LinkedIn, content strategy, etc. I only work with 10 personal branding clients a year. 😊✔️ Speaking at your event: I’ve done talks at INBOUND, VidCon, TEDx, and more.✔️ Esports — one of my main passions is esports (and just gaming overall). I will be helping endemic & non-endemic brands via connections, sponsorships, and branding/personal branding.Feel free to reach out to me here, via email, or you can learn more about me on my website: quentinallums.com",1 year ago,"Real talk: My first two companies failed.  A big difference between those startups and my current company is this: there is now one person accountable for every major area of our business. 2019 was our best year. But it was also a very hard year because we spent the bulk of it working with our business coach [ Rebecca Heidepriem ]. We were getting organized, working on systems & processes, and just making our services better. It was painful 😅. In a good way. 2020 is already our best year in business and we're only in Q1.  There should only be one person accountable for each part of the business. For smaller teams that one person can be accountable for multiple parts of the business, but you should never have two people accountable for the same area. Because nothing gets done that way. Someone has to be in charge. Sales is a HUGE part of my role. But I report to Izzy when it comes to sales because he's accountable for that part of the business. Whereas I'm accountable for the overall vision.  It helps us stay organized and make more money.  And who doesn't like more money... 😜 #justQ  🖖🏾🖤  #startups   #entrepreneurship

In an uncertain world, strong employee engagement will future-proof your company. Last year showed the business world how easily our goals, visions, and profitability can radically change. The way we work has changed. Forever. And that’s a good thing because it gives us an opportunity to re-engage with HOW and WHY our employees work. Consider this:• 72% of workers surveyed by the World Economic Forum want a hybrid remote-office model;• 64% of the U.S. workforce is disengaged;• 69% of employees are experiencing burnout symptoms while working from home; and• Almost 9 in 10 (89%) US workers have experienced burnout in the last yearYour team works from home now, in some capacity. And while your workforce may want a hybrid-office work model now and for the future, they are experiencing higher-than-ever levels of burnout. Burnout leads to disengagement, and disengaged workforces underperform. Now is the time to transition, support, empower, and inspire your employees to perform at a higher and happier level.Employee engagement must be your critical business objective if you want organizational agility, ongoing profitability and performance, customer satisfaction, and fulfilled team members.As a best-selling author, consultant, and coach for over 15 years, I have worked with organizations of all sizes around the world to improve the engagement and productivity of their teams and the efficacy of their leadership. I equip, empower, and inspire them to:• Develop their managers as both engagers of their people and keepers of the culture • Address remote culture breakdowns and “death by Zoom”• Elevate performance and productivity to work smarter in a remote world• Connect individual contributors to organizational goals and hold them accountable for results• Empower their managers to lead agile, high-performance, hybrid teams• Streamline communication channel overwhelm and tame their inboxMy clients have had these results…$2 million in additional revenue per year• ""Our total sales calls per week are up over 20% from the prior year.

In an uncertain world, strong employee engagement will future-proof your company. Last year showed the business world how easily our goals, visions, and profitability can radically change. The way we work has changed. Forever. And that’s a good thing because it gives us an opportunity to re-engage with HOW and WHY our employees work. Consider this:• 72% of workers surveyed by the World Economic Forum want a hybrid remote-office model;• 64% of the U.S. workforce is disengaged;• 69% of employees are experiencing burnout symptoms while working from home; and• Almost 9 in 10 (89%) US workers have experienced burnout in the last yearYour team works from home now, in some capacity. And while your workforce may want a hybrid-office work model now and for the future, they are experiencing higher-than-ever levels of burnout. Burnout leads to disengagement, and disengaged workforces underperform. Now is the time to transition, support, empower, and inspire your employees to perform at a higher and happier level.Employee engagement must be your critical business objective if you want organizational agility, ongoing profitability and performance, customer satisfaction, and fulfilled team members.As a best-selling author, consultant, and coach for over 15 years, I have worked with organizations of all sizes around the world to improve the engagement and productivity of their teams and the efficacy of their leadership. I equip, empower, and inspire them to:• Develop their managers as both engagers of their people and keepers of the culture • Address remote culture breakdowns and “death by Zoom”• Elevate performance and productivity to work smarter in a remote world• Connect individual contributors to organizational goals and hold them accountable for results• Empower their managers to lead agile, high-performance, hybrid teams• Streamline communication channel overwhelm and tame their inboxMy clients have had these results…$2 million in additional revenue per year• ""Our total sales calls per week are up over 20% from the prior year. These additional calls per week should easily translate into $2 million in additional revenue per year."" - Chris Pope, VP of Distribution, Process Management and Sales Training, Coca-Cola Consolidated13,000 labor hours saved • ""After implementing the Meeting Revolution program we eliminated redundant meetings and shortened the average length of our meetings, saving 13,000 labor hours."" - VP of PharmacovigilanceLet’s connect: carson.tate@workingsimply.com.",2 years ago,"Stop making flawed assumptions when you delegate a task. Ask yourself, “Where am I making assumptions about the skills and knowledge of the person to whom I am delegating this task or project? Have I assumed that they are clear on the goals of the project? Have I assumed that they understand the terms I am using, that they have the skills and knowledge needed or the time, tools, and other resources required?” Check your assumptions. When they do not match reality, take steps to fill the gaps by providing the missing knowledge, skills, tools, and resources. Loved this tip? There's 98 more!

It urged us to adopt solutions that we would have been reluctant to adopt otherwise, or just years or decades later. Now they passed the test, and even endeared themselves to medical staff.

Amazon is selling my new book, Trauma Doesn’t Stop at the School Door, for a steeply discounted price: under $20 for the ebook!!!  Makes it very affordable!!!  And it is a book that helps schools, colleges and businesses reopen as more trauma responsive entities.  I like ebooks — even when I am not traveling.  Best to buy now before algorithm changes and price returns to retail of over $30. And when you read the book, share thoughts with me — the book has in the trenches strategies and actions to enable change — at low cost — to ameliorate trauma.  And trauma abounds these days — even more since the Pandemic.

There is an interesting story in MIT Tech Review about what A.I. is capable of in imaging. Rizwan Malik, radiologist at the Royal Bolton Hospital, turned to A.I. to make his job easier. In his hospital, patients often had to wait six hours or more for a specialist to look at their x-rays. If an emergency room doctor could get an initial reading from an A.I.-based tool, it could dramatically shrink that wait time. A specialist could follow up the A.I. system’s reading later. So last year, Malik identified a promising A.I.-based chest x-ray system called qXR from  Qure.ai  and proposed to test the system over six months. As COVID-19 jumped into our lives, they also had to re-design the system that now is capable of identifying coronavirus-specific signs. Such a fast response and iteration is only possible in the case of A.I.-based medical technologies. This is why it's so crucial that the FDA, for example, started analyzing companies instead of individual algorithms for approval. Also, there are so many COVID-19 related ongoing A.I. projects in medical imaging, that Stanford started to curate many:  https://lnkd.in/gE_rdhP #themedicalfuturist   #AI

From his basement, he launched SoftKey Software Products. As sales took off, Kevin moved to headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts and went on an industry consolidating acquisition binge.From 1995 to 1999 he bought out almost every one of his software competitors, including Mindscape, Broderbund and the Learning Company in the industry's first vicious public hostile battle. Shareholders loved his take-no-prisoners, cost cutting style and fueled him with billions to do his deals.In 1999 Kevin sold his company to the Mattel Toy Company for $4.2 billion, one of the largest deals ever done in the consumer software industry. To keep his money working hard, he took control of his wealth from his lackluster money managers and founded his own mutual fund company, O'Leary Funds. He raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors who share his ""get paid while you wait"" yield oriented, value investing philosophy. He shares his tips and tribulations with a national television audience and turns The Street upside down in the process.As a self-proclaimed ""Eco-preneur,"" Kevin looks hardest for investments that make money - and are environmentally friendly. When he's not squeezing the market from his office, he travels the world looking for new opportunities to deploy his capital.

Wrong.  People are emotionally attached to their beliefs. If you mercilessly expose every flaw in a person's reasoning, they’ll feel attacked. The amygdala will take over, and their focus will no longer be on listening or reasonable discussion; rather, they will defend themselves or attack in return. Instead, focus on learning more about the other person’s viewpoint, as well as the reasons behind their feelings. Then, work to re-establish common ground, with the goal of laying a foundation you can build upon. Above all, strive to leave the conversation on a positive note. Remember that lasting influence takes time. Your goal isn’t to “win the argument” or change someone’s mind in a single discussion. Rather, strive to see the bigger picture.

In an uncertain world, strong employee engagement will future-proof your company. Last year showed the business world how easily our goals, visions, and profitability can radically change. The way we work has changed. Forever. And that’s a good thing because it gives us an opportunity to re-engage with HOW and WHY our employees work. Consider this:• 72% of workers surveyed by the World Economic Forum want a hybrid remote-office model;• 64% of the U.S. workforce is disengaged;• 69% of employees are experiencing burnout symptoms while working from home; and• Almost 9 in 10 (89%) US workers have experienced burnout in the last yearYour team works from home now, in some capacity. And while your workforce may want a hybrid-office work model now and for the future, they are experiencing higher-than-ever levels of burnout. Burnout leads to disengagement, and disengaged workforces underperform. Now is the time to transition, support, empower, and inspire your employees to perform at a higher and happier level.Employee engagement must be your critical business objective if you want organizational agility, ongoing profitability and performance, customer satisfaction, and fulfilled team members.As a best-selling author, consultant, and coach for over 15 years, I have worked with organizations of all sizes around the world to improve the engagement and productivity of their teams and the efficacy of their leadership. I equip, empower, and inspire them to:• Develop their managers as both engagers of their people and keepers of the culture • Address remote culture breakdowns and “death by Zoom”• Elevate performance and productivity to work smarter in a remote world• Connect individual contributors to organizational goals and hold them accountable for results• Empower their managers to lead agile, high-performance, hybrid teams• Streamline communication channel overwhelm and tame their inboxMy clients have had these results…$2 million in additional revenue per year• ""Our total sales calls per week are up over 20% from the prior year.

In an uncertain world, strong employee engagement will future-proof your company. Last year showed the business world how easily our goals, visions, and profitability can radically change. The way we work has changed. Forever. And that’s a good thing because it gives us an opportunity to re-engage with HOW and WHY our employees work. Consider this:• 72% of workers surveyed by the World Economic Forum want a hybrid remote-office model;• 64% of the U.S. workforce is disengaged;• 69% of employees are experiencing burnout symptoms while working from home; and• Almost 9 in 10 (89%) US workers have experienced burnout in the last yearYour team works from home now, in some capacity. And while your workforce may want a hybrid-office work model now and for the future, they are experiencing higher-than-ever levels of burnout. Burnout leads to disengagement, and disengaged workforces underperform. Now is the time to transition, support, empower, and inspire your employees to perform at a higher and happier level.Employee engagement must be your critical business objective if you want organizational agility, ongoing profitability and performance, customer satisfaction, and fulfilled team members.As a best-selling author, consultant, and coach for over 15 years, I have worked with organizations of all sizes around the world to improve the engagement and productivity of their teams and the efficacy of their leadership. I equip, empower, and inspire them to:• Develop their managers as both engagers of their people and keepers of the culture • Address remote culture breakdowns and “death by Zoom”• Elevate performance and productivity to work smarter in a remote world• Connect individual contributors to organizational goals and hold them accountable for results• Empower their managers to lead agile, high-performance, hybrid teams• Streamline communication channel overwhelm and tame their inboxMy clients have had these results…$2 million in additional revenue per year• ""Our total sales calls per week are up over 20% from the prior year.

Yesterday, the Business Roundtable, a group of nearly 200 of the most powerful CEOs in America, made a pretty big announcement. It's called ""Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation."" Before reading it, see if you can see what's changed by quickly comparing just 2 sentences. This one is from a statement made by the organization way back in 1997: ""In the Business Roundtable's view, the paramount duty of management and of boards of directors is to the corporation's stockholders; the interests of other stakeholders are relevant as a derivative of the duty to stockholders."" And this one's from yesterday's statement: ""While each of our individual companies serves its own corporate purpose, we share a fundamental commitment to all of our stakeholders."" Did you notice the difference? Basically, it comes down to 2 words.

As I wrote in today's  New York Times , the revision doesn't change the big picture: The labor market is in good shape. But 500,000 jobs is a lot of jobs! Certainly enough to deserve attention. And it's the latest evidence that the economy might not have been as strong last year as we thought -- which is significant, because the economy has slowed further since then. Plus, as  LinkedIn  Chief Economist  Guy Berger, Ph.D.  told me, big data revisions can be a sign that the economy is at a turning point -- a troubling thought given the other economic warning signs out there right now.

In an uncertain world, strong employee engagement will future-proof your company. Last year showed the business world how easily our goals, visions, and profitability can radically change. The way we work has changed. Forever. And that’s a good thing because it gives us an opportunity to re-engage with HOW and WHY our employees work. Consider this:• 72% of workers surveyed by the World Economic Forum want a hybrid remote-office model;• 64% of the U.S. workforce is disengaged;• 69% of employees are experiencing burnout symptoms while working from home; and• Almost 9 in 10 (89%) US workers have experienced burnout in the last yearYour team works from home now, in some capacity. And while your workforce may want a hybrid-office work model now and for the future, they are experiencing higher-than-ever levels of burnout. Burnout leads to disengagement, and disengaged workforces underperform. Now is the time to transition, support, empower, and inspire your employees to perform at a higher and happier level.Employee engagement must be your critical business objective if you want organizational agility, ongoing profitability and performance, customer satisfaction, and fulfilled team members.As a best-selling author, consultant, and coach for over 15 years, I have worked with organizations of all sizes around the world to improve the engagement and productivity of their teams and the efficacy of their leadership. I equip, empower, and inspire them to:• Develop their managers as both engagers of their people and keepers of the culture • Address remote culture breakdowns and “death by Zoom”• Elevate performance and productivity to work smarter in a remote world• Connect individual contributors to organizational goals and hold them accountable for results• Empower their managers to lead agile, high-performance, hybrid teams• Streamline communication channel overwhelm and tame their inboxMy clients have had these results…$2 million in additional revenue per year• ""Our total sales calls per week are up over 20% from the prior year.

In an uncertain world, strong employee engagement will future-proof your company. Last year showed the business world how easily our goals, visions, and profitability can radically change. The way we work has changed. Forever. And that’s a good thing because it gives us an opportunity to re-engage with HOW and WHY our employees work. Consider this:• 72% of workers surveyed by the World Economic Forum want a hybrid remote-office model;• 64% of the U.S. workforce is disengaged;• 69% of employees are experiencing burnout symptoms while working from home; and• Almost 9 in 10 (89%) US workers have experienced burnout in the last yearYour team works from home now, in some capacity. And while your workforce may want a hybrid-office work model now and for the future, they are experiencing higher-than-ever levels of burnout. Burnout leads to disengagement, and disengaged workforces underperform. Now is the time to transition, support, empower, and inspire your employees to perform at a higher and happier level.Employee engagement must be your critical business objective if you want organizational agility, ongoing profitability and performance, customer satisfaction, and fulfilled team members.As a best-selling author, consultant, and coach for over 15 years, I have worked with organizations of all sizes around the world to improve the engagement and productivity of their teams and the efficacy of their leadership. I equip, empower, and inspire them to:• Develop their managers as both engagers of their people and keepers of the culture • Address remote culture breakdowns and “death by Zoom”• Elevate performance and productivity to work smarter in a remote world• Connect individual contributors to organizational goals and hold them accountable for results• Empower their managers to lead agile, high-performance, hybrid teams• Streamline communication channel overwhelm and tame their inboxMy clients have had these results…$2 million in additional revenue per year• ""Our total sales calls per week are up over 20% from the prior year.

In an uncertain world, strong employee engagement will future-proof your company. Last year showed the business world how easily our goals, visions, and profitability can radically change. The way we work has changed. Forever. And that’s a good thing because it gives us an opportunity to re-engage with HOW and WHY our employees work. Consider this:• 72% of workers surveyed by the World Economic Forum want a hybrid remote-office model;• 64% of the U.S. workforce is disengaged;• 69% of employees are experiencing burnout symptoms while working from home; and• Almost 9 in 10 (89%) US workers have experienced burnout in the last yearYour team works from home now, in some capacity. And while your workforce may want a hybrid-office work model now and for the future, they are experiencing higher-than-ever levels of burnout. Burnout leads to disengagement, and disengaged workforces underperform. Now is the time to transition, support, empower, and inspire your employees to perform at a higher and happier level.Employee engagement must be your critical business objective if you want organizational agility, ongoing profitability and performance, customer satisfaction, and fulfilled team members.As a best-selling author, consultant, and coach for over 15 years, I have worked with organizations of all sizes around the world to improve the engagement and productivity of their teams and the efficacy of their leadership. I equip, empower, and inspire them to:• Develop their managers as both engagers of their people and keepers of the culture • Address remote culture breakdowns and “death by Zoom”• Elevate performance and productivity to work smarter in a remote world• Connect individual contributors to organizational goals and hold them accountable for results• Empower their managers to lead agile, high-performance, hybrid teams• Streamline communication channel overwhelm and tame their inboxMy clients have had these results…$2 million in additional revenue per year• ""Our total sales calls per week are up over 20% from the prior year.

In an uncertain world, strong employee engagement will future-proof your company. Last year showed the business world how easily our goals, visions, and profitability can radically change. The way we work has changed. Forever. And that’s a good thing because it gives us an opportunity to re-engage with HOW and WHY our employees work. Consider this:• 72% of workers surveyed by the World Economic Forum want a hybrid remote-office model;• 64% of the U.S. workforce is disengaged;• 69% of employees are experiencing burnout symptoms while working from home; and• Almost 9 in 10 (89%) US workers have experienced burnout in the last yearYour team works from home now, in some capacity. And while your workforce may want a hybrid-office work model now and for the future, they are experiencing higher-than-ever levels of burnout. Burnout leads to disengagement, and disengaged workforces underperform. Now is the time to transition, support, empower, and inspire your employees to perform at a higher and happier level.Employee engagement must be your critical business objective if you want organizational agility, ongoing profitability and performance, customer satisfaction, and fulfilled team members.As a best-selling author, consultant, and coach for over 15 years, I have worked with organizations of all sizes around the world to improve the engagement and productivity of their teams and the efficacy of their leadership.

I hate this term. Nobody is ""following"" me, I'm not leading anyone or being a Guru.  I'm a well intentioned provocative background element that sparks things.  I'm not an influencer, a thought leader or a ""brand"". I'm just lucky to have a platform to be an enabler of debates about the future.I don't know more than others, but I know enough to ask good questions and listen to those who know more about things.  My style is provocative. I do this to get better and more passionate answers, not because I care one iota about engagement stats or building a community, but because I'm curious and like to learn.I passionately believe that we're alive at the most interesting time in the world, that new technology is making incredible things possible and that it creates enormously exciting and profound new things achievable for many people and businesses.  I also think change is misunderstood, that many things are not changing, that many movements create existential threats and I'm here to try to provide guidance through this.",2 months ago,"I wish I could buy stock in the States of Florida and Texas and short NY and Ca. I still think working from home won't be the default for a changed working world, and we're not on the edge of a leapfrog to a new era. But I think eyes are slowly opening to  the lack of logic in forcing employees to work from extremely expensive, stressful, high tax locations on the basis of it ""being what world class companies do"" and to be near each other.

In an uncertain world, strong employee engagement will future-proof your company. Last year showed the business world how easily our goals, visions, and profitability can radically change. The way we work has changed. Forever. And that’s a good thing because it gives us an opportunity to re-engage with HOW and WHY our employees work. Consider this:• 72% of workers surveyed by the World Economic Forum want a hybrid remote-office model;• 64% of the U.S. workforce is disengaged;• 69% of employees are experiencing burnout symptoms while working from home; and• Almost 9 in 10 (89%) US workers have experienced burnout in the last yearYour team works from home now, in some capacity. And while your workforce may want a hybrid-office work model now and for the future, they are experiencing higher-than-ever levels of burnout. Burnout leads to disengagement, and disengaged workforces underperform. Now is the time to transition, support, empower, and inspire your employees to perform at a higher and happier level.Employee engagement must be your critical business objective if you want organizational agility, ongoing profitability and performance, customer satisfaction, and fulfilled team members.As a best-selling author, consultant, and coach for over 15 years, I have worked with organizations of all sizes around the world to improve the engagement and productivity of their teams and the efficacy of their leadership. I equip, empower, and inspire them to:• Develop their managers as both engagers of their people and keepers of the culture • Address remote culture breakdowns and “death by Zoom”• Elevate performance and productivity to work smarter in a remote world• Connect individual contributors to organizational goals and hold them accountable for results• Empower their managers to lead agile, high-performance, hybrid teams• Streamline communication channel overwhelm and tame their inboxMy clients have had these results…$2 million in additional revenue per year• ""Our total sales calls per week are up over 20% from the prior year.

If you only use your content to sell, you’ll turn people off. Instead, strive to be of service.   If you go on and on, meandering your way through a very long post with little punctuation, run-on sentences, and no clear point, you’ll lose people.   If a reader takes the time to like, comment, and share your stuff, make sure to acknowledge their kindness.   And on that note, be sure to like, comment and share other people’s content that you think your network would find valuable. If it resonated with you, it probably will with others.   The best way to discover interesting and valuable content is to read — a lot.   Follow people whose writing you admire, whether in your industry or not, and seek many sources of information, even if it makes you uncomfortable. You never know what you’ll learn and from whom. Be open.   Content can inform, entertain, persuade, or inspire. Choose wisely.   Be yourself. Write the way you speak.   And be consistent — in your creation, your voice, your sharing, your engagement.   Because my biggest takeaway is this:  Content may be king, but content comes from people. And people connect with people.

As the chief storyteller for my organization, I take great pleasure in creating compelling, brand conscious content strategies to help my partners: generate leads, convert customers or increase awareness or engagement around their products and services. My ability to build authentic, digital narratives that capture market share and today's number one currency — attention — is not only extremely valuable for my executive partners, it's something I thoroughly enjoy. For me, strategic communications is fun as well as valuable. I welcome the opportunities I've enjoyed to work in tandem with leaders across verticals to convey a unified message inside and outside an organization. At the end of the day, no matter what form they take, communications should holistically advance a distinct brand that unifies an organization's mission, goals, aspirations, and talent.As a journalist, I've conducted thousands of interviews with leaders in almost every industry there is. As an editor I've led B2B magazine launches and produced celebrated monthly print and digital publications with tens of thousands of global readers.

In an uncertain world, strong employee engagement will future-proof your company. Last year showed the business world how easily our goals, visions, and profitability can radically change. The way we work has changed. Forever. And that’s a good thing because it gives us an opportunity to re-engage with HOW and WHY our employees work. Consider this:• 72% of workers surveyed by the World Economic Forum want a hybrid remote-office model;• 64% of the U.S. workforce is disengaged;• 69% of employees are experiencing burnout symptoms while working from home; and• Almost 9 in 10 (89%) US workers have experienced burnout in the last yearYour team works from home now, in some capacity. And while your workforce may want a hybrid-office work model now and for the future, they are experiencing higher-than-ever levels of burnout. Burnout leads to disengagement, and disengaged workforces underperform. Now is the time to transition, support, empower, and inspire your employees to perform at a higher and happier level.Employee engagement must be your critical business objective if you want organizational agility, ongoing profitability and performance, customer satisfaction, and fulfilled team members.As a best-selling author, consultant, and coach for over 15 years, I have worked with organizations of all sizes around the world to improve the engagement and productivity of their teams and the efficacy of their leadership. I equip, empower, and inspire them to:• Develop their managers as both engagers of their people and keepers of the culture • Address remote culture breakdowns and “death by Zoom”• Elevate performance and productivity to work smarter in a remote world• Connect individual contributors to organizational goals and hold them accountable for results• Empower their managers to lead agile, high-performance, hybrid teams• Streamline communication channel overwhelm and tame their inboxMy clients have had these results…$2 million in additional revenue per year• ""Our total sales calls per week are up over 20% from the prior year.

In an uncertain world, strong employee engagement will future-proof your company. Last year showed the business world how easily our goals, visions, and profitability can radically change. The way we work has changed. Forever. And that’s a good thing because it gives us an opportunity to re-engage with HOW and WHY our employees work. Consider this:• 72% of workers surveyed by the World Economic Forum want a hybrid remote-office model;• 64% of the U.S. workforce is disengaged;• 69% of employees are experiencing burnout symptoms while working from home; and• Almost 9 in 10 (89%) US workers have experienced burnout in the last yearYour team works from home now, in some capacity. And while your workforce may want a hybrid-office work model now and for the future, they are experiencing higher-than-ever levels of burnout. Burnout leads to disengagement, and disengaged workforces underperform. Now is the time to transition, support, empower, and inspire your employees to perform at a higher and happier level.Employee engagement must be your critical business objective if you want organizational agility, ongoing profitability and performance, customer satisfaction, and fulfilled team members.As a best-selling author, consultant, and coach for over 15 years, I have worked with organizations of all sizes around the world to improve the engagement and productivity of their teams and the efficacy of their leadership. I equip, empower, and inspire them to:• Develop their managers as both engagers of their people and keepers of the culture • Address remote culture breakdowns and “death by Zoom”• Elevate performance and productivity to work smarter in a remote world• Connect individual contributors to organizational goals and hold them accountable for results• Empower their managers to lead agile, high-performance, hybrid teams• Streamline communication channel overwhelm and tame their inboxMy clients have had these results…$2 million in additional revenue per year• ""Our total sales calls per week are up over 20% from the prior year.

From his basement, he launched SoftKey Software Products. As sales took off, Kevin moved to headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts and went on an industry consolidating acquisition binge.From 1995 to 1999 he bought out almost every one of his software competitors, including Mindscape, Broderbund and the Learning Company in the industry's first vicious public hostile battle. Shareholders loved his take-no-prisoners, cost cutting style and fueled him with billions to do his deals.In 1999 Kevin sold his company to the Mattel Toy Company for $4.2 billion, one of the largest deals ever done in the consumer software industry. To keep his money working hard, he took control of his wealth from his lackluster money managers and founded his own mutual fund company, O'Leary Funds. He raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors who share his ""get paid while you wait"" yield oriented, value investing philosophy. He shares his tips and tribulations with a national television audience and turns The Street upside down in the process.As a self-proclaimed ""Eco-preneur,"" Kevin looks hardest for investments that make money - and are environmentally friendly. When he's not squeezing the market from his office, he travels the world looking for new opportunities to deploy his capital. He is on the investment committee of Boston's prestigious 200-year-old Hamilton Trust.He launched O’Shares ETFs, a group of exchange traded funds.

Exposing exceptional truths like these about our industry has earned me the nickname: “unapologetic marketing truth-teller.” (Thanks Andrew.)As the conversation around marketing evolves in a digital age, I also partner with brands to amplify stories of transformation, and trends in customer experience. I’m having way too much fun. I have been named ""one of the most interesting people in B2B marketing"" (thanks Ruth) and a top voice on LinkedIn 3X. My career has included adventures as a founder/CMO, an in-house B2B marketer, a PR agency survivor, an on-demand ghostwriter and consultant, and a ""Director of Buzz” for high-growth startups.I also served as the Executive Director of Boston Content, New England’s largest community of content professionals.I’m the author of Trust Me, B2B, a short book about building long-term trust through marketing, but most importantly, they call me ""the beast"" on my modified fastpitch softball team.

Glass Half-Full, or Half-Empty? People who view life as ‘glass half-full’ tend to be more optimistic and believe ‘things will work out.’ Those of us who are ‘glass half-empty’ are always preparing for things to go awry... But an increasing number of recent long-term studies have linked greater optimism to a lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease and other chronic ailments and to fostering “exceptional longevity,” a category one team of researchers used for people who live to 85 and beyond. I guess this makes  sense...Optimists tend to take better care of their health. They’re more likely to exercise and eat better and are less likely to smoke, while pessimists bathe their bodies in damaging stress hormones! The good news is that we can change the way we think! The first step is to learn to catch yourself when thinking negatively—just that thought alone can can help turn ‘glass half-empty’ people into ‘glass half-full’ people! Selected Excerpt: “It’s never too early and it’s never too late to foster optimism. From teenagers to people in their 90s, all have better outcomes if they’re optimistic.”

In 2016 my friend asked to interview me about a new startup I was starting. I remember thinking to myself *OMG NO* because the thought of being on camera terrified me. For some reason, I agreed to do it anyway.It went terribly & I was so embarrassed. After that, I made a promise to myself to master the art of being on camera and ended up recording a video for +500 straight days. Eventually that lead me to LinkedIn, where I became one of the first video influencers. Long story short, my first company (a virtual reality startup) failed within months. My second company (an agency that focused on LinkedIn personal branding) found some success as I started to grow but ultimately was just me and I wanted more. My third company (video storytelling, personal branding, and signature experiences) found a lot of success before we decided to close down amidst Covid-19.There were a lot of ups & downs throughout 2016-2021:▶ Power being turned off.▶ Sleeping on my office floor.▶ Pushing myself to speak: TEDx talk, INBOUND, VidCon, and over 50 other events.▶ Launching a podcast that hit top 50 on day one — Stupid Deep.▶ Building a company with some of my best friends — and being able to employ 10 others full-time.▶ And I could go on and on and on.My little brother passed away in 2019. Going through that, COVID, and everything else going on in our world I knew that I needed something new. I interviewed Lewis Howes on my podcast. A handful of months later I joined his team at Greatness Media as the marketing lead. That’s where I’m at now and I’m enjoying every second of it. Collectively my videos, thoughts, podcasts, and writing have been viewed over 15 million times.How I can help you:✔️ Podcast Sponsorship: My show Stupid Deep is a cinematic podcast. It’s grown quickly and I’m not slowing down anytime soon.✔️ Personal Branding consulting: Growth, strategy, LinkedIn, content strategy, etc. I only work with 10 personal branding clients a year. 😊✔️ Speaking at your event: I’ve done talks at INBOUND, VidCon, TEDx, and more.✔️ Esports — one of my main passions is esports (and just gaming overall).

I had no plan. And I guess long term that worked out for me.  But where I wish I could go back and reframe my thinking is this: I thought it was wrong to build something on the side.  I thought I would lose respect if I took a part-time job (even though I was struggling to keep the lights on). I looked down on people that didn’t jump all in. Which was SO naive of me.  I thought building a business was easy. Because the people I followed kind of made it look easy. One of the things I struggle with most as a creator & entrepreneur is showing the reality. I don’t show: ✅ The boring stuff. ✅ Us getting ripped apart by our business coach every week 😅😭. ✅ How much work actually goes into this. ✅ The many mistakes we make.  ✅ And I could go on and on. Thank you  Cory Savage  for prompting this thought. And thank you i.c stars for asking me to do the commencement speech this year.  2020 I want to spend more time talking about (and showing) the stuff that many of us tend to avoid.

Every day, we read headlines about how quickly the novel coronavirus is spreading, the rising death toll, and how more and more employees losing their jobs. Of course, this type of news triggers a huge amount of anxiety. As an employer, how can you help your people to cope? One way is by using emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is the ability to identify, understand, and manage emotions--both your own, and those of others. Put more simply, it's the ability to make emotions work for you, instead of against you. Emotional intelligence can be especially beneficial during a time of crisis as it can help you to avoid panic and to think rationally. It can also help you to connect with your people on an emotional level. So, how can you employers use emotional intelligence when dealing with employees?

Shareholders loved his take-no-prisoners, cost cutting style and fueled him with billions to do his deals.In 1999 Kevin sold his company to the Mattel Toy Company for $4.2 billion, one of the largest deals ever done in the consumer software industry. To keep his money working hard, he took control of his wealth from his lackluster money managers and founded his own mutual fund company, O'Leary Funds. He raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors who share his ""get paid while you wait"" yield oriented, value investing philosophy. He shares his tips and tribulations with a national television audience and turns The Street upside down in the process.As a self-proclaimed ""Eco-preneur,"" Kevin looks hardest for investments that make money - and are environmentally friendly.

In an uncertain world, strong employee engagement will future-proof your company. Last year showed the business world how easily our goals, visions, and profitability can radically change. The way we work has changed. Forever. And that’s a good thing because it gives us an opportunity to re-engage with HOW and WHY our employees work. Consider this:• 72% of workers surveyed by the World Economic Forum want a hybrid remote-office model;• 64% of the U.S. workforce is disengaged;• 69% of employees are experiencing burnout symptoms while working from home; and• Almost 9 in 10 (89%) US workers have experienced burnout in the last yearYour team works from home now, in some capacity. And while your workforce may want a hybrid-office work model now and for the future, they are experiencing higher-than-ever levels of burnout. Burnout leads to disengagement, and disengaged workforces underperform. Now is the time to transition, support, empower, and inspire your employees to perform at a higher and happier level.Employee engagement must be your critical business objective if you want organizational agility, ongoing profitability and performance, customer satisfaction, and fulfilled team members.As a best-selling author, consultant, and coach for over 15 years, I have worked with organizations of all sizes around the world to improve the engagement and productivity of their teams and the efficacy of their leadership. I equip, empower, and inspire them to:• Develop their managers as both engagers of their people and keepers of the culture • Address remote culture breakdowns and “death by Zoom”• Elevate performance and productivity to work smarter in a remote world• Connect individual contributors to organizational goals and hold them accountable for results• Empower their managers to lead agile, high-performance, hybrid teams• Streamline communication channel overwhelm and tame their inboxMy clients have had these results…$2 million in additional revenue per year• ""Our total sales calls per week are up over 20% from the prior year.

With everything going on (you know what I mean...) there seems to be an uptick on advice on Leading or Leadership. Topics like  ‘How to be a Good/Great Leader During Times Like These’ is everywhere.  Helpful thoughts certainly but I’d suggest what is really needed right now is advice on ‘How to be a Great Follower,’ and ‘what Does Followership Look Like in Times Like These.’  First off, without Followers, Leaders fail. Leaders without Followers are either phonies, extremists or untrustworthy.  The role of Followers is not talked about enough. Followers alone are responsible for the success of Leaders. Without followers there are no leaders. For any project or organization to succeed, there must be strong, ethical people who willingly and effectively follow.  In these times—and in the context of Global Public Health Uncertainty—Followers uphold moral, cultural and community rule-of-laws. We are the Effector Arms and Legs of all the right and correct actions that must be taken. But it means honoring social distancing. But it also means considering  our neighbors and community members by not hoarding or becoming rude, disrespectful or unethical. So go and do the right thing...And as my Dad would say, ‘Stay Out of Trouble.’

I just read an article on donations to colleges and universities and how they failed to vet the source of donations — namely from Jeffrey Epstein. The Higher Education Times (a UK publication) said anonymity was an approach although not fully protective.   3 thoughts: 1.  How carefully ARE donations actually vetted in real life on campuses?  Sure, smaller colleges can vet more, and big donations stand out everywhere as worthy of vetting.   But how much money comes in from sources that, if we looked, would be deemed institutionally unacceptable?   2.  Cozying up to donors is a big part of fundraising.  So didn’t these institutions meet and stay in touch w/ Epstein?  Harvard said it isn’t returning the $$ it got. Is that because it was received before convictions? Didn’t Harvard send updates/reports to him?  Couldn’t Harvard show some grace and donate an identical amount to fund for his victims?  Ok: just return it. 3.  Wouldn’t it be easy to fool a college/university as to a donation’s source? Just create layers. Now ask: Is Sackler money being returned or just new $$ not bring taken by educational institutions? I’d say we need to do more thinking about donor source. Honorary Degrees too.

DM me for more info on podcast sponsorship or personal branding ⤵️,"['Milwaukee,', 'Wisconsin,', 'United', 'States']",66387.0,500+,"Hey, I'm #justQ 🖖🏽! In 2016 my friend asked to interview me about a new startup I was starting. I remember thinking to myself *OMG NO* because the thought of being on camera terrified me. For some reason, I agreed to do it anyway.It went terribly & I was so embarrassed. After that, I made a promise to myself to master the art of being on camera and ended up recording a video for +500 straight days. Eventually that lead me to LinkedIn, where I became one of the first video influencers. Long story short, my first company (a virtual reality startup) failed within months. My second company (an agency that focused on LinkedIn personal branding) found some success as I started to grow but ultimately was just me and I wanted more. My third company (video storytelling, personal branding, and signature experiences) found a lot of success before we decided to close down amidst Covid-19.There were a lot of ups & downs throughout 2016-2021:▶ Power being turned off.▶ Sleeping on my office floor.▶ Pushing myself to speak: TEDx talk, INBOUND, VidCon, and over 50 other events.▶ Launching a podcast that hit top 50 on day one — Stupid Deep.▶ Building a company with some of my best friends — and being able to employ 10 others full-time.▶ And I could go on and on and on.My little brother passed away in 2019. Going through that, COVID, and everything else going on in our world I knew that I needed something new. I interviewed Lewis Howes on my podcast. A handful of months later I joined his team at Greatness Media as the marketing lead. That’s where I’m at now and I’m enjoying every second of it. Collectively my videos, thoughts, podcasts, and writing have been viewed over 15 million times.How I can help you:✔️ Podcast Sponsorship: My show Stupid Deep is a cinematic podcast. It’s grown quickly and I’m not slowing down anytime soon.✔️ Personal Branding consulting: Growth, strategy, LinkedIn, content strategy, etc. I only work with 10 personal branding clients a year. 😊✔️ Speaking at your event: I’ve done talks at INBOUND, VidCon, TEDx, and more.✔️ Esports — one of my main passions is esports (and just gaming overall). I will be helping endemic & non-endemic brands via connections, sponsorships, and branding/personal branding.Feel free to reach out to me here, via email, or you can learn more about me on my website: quentinallums.com",1 year ago,"I’m no longer editing my videos — which is incredibly hard for me. 🥺 But here’s the thing: 1). I’m an entrepreneur first & a content creator second. My business is my priority. Outsourcing this part allows me to still create and focus on my business. 2). I need to lean into my strengths, which is the messaging. The story. And by doing that I can empower someone else by allowing them to lean into theirs. Video editing. 3). Allowing others to edit for me, ensures that I have ultimate clarity around my brand. Because everything created still has to feel like me. Just something to think about if you’re a creator building a business. Do you edit your own content or do you outsource? And why?

Ask yourself if you’re committing these common  #thoughtleadership  sins: 1. You only share the wins Nothing is a bigger turnoff than someone who is continuously boasting. People respond to those who are genuine and admit when they’ve made a mistake. 2. You push your product or service Don’t make the mistake of using your platform for blatant self-promotion. Instead, provide value by serving, not selling.  3. You try to cover too much ground Stick to those few areas where you are expert. When you stay within your wheelhouse, your audience sees you as the go-to person. 4. You never get to the point Meandering signals that you’re unorganized and unsure. Keep to one brief, compelling message. 5. You share haphazardly or infrequently Regularly and consistently publish your wisdom, so your network looks forward to—and trusts—your insights and observations. 6. You post & ghost Merely posting isn’t enough; you want to start conversations and build relationships, so engage with those who engage with your posts. 7.

In an uncertain world, strong employee engagement will future-proof your company. Last year showed the business world how easily our goals, visions, and profitability can radically change. The way we work has changed. Forever. And that’s a good thing because it gives us an opportunity to re-engage with HOW and WHY our employees work. Consider this:• 72% of workers surveyed by the World Economic Forum want a hybrid remote-office model;• 64% of the U.S. workforce is disengaged;• 69% of employees are experiencing burnout symptoms while working from home; and• Almost 9 in 10 (89%) US workers have experienced burnout in the last yearYour team works from home now, in some capacity. And while your workforce may want a hybrid-office work model now and for the future, they are experiencing higher-than-ever levels of burnout. Burnout leads to disengagement, and disengaged workforces underperform. Now is the time to transition, support, empower, and inspire your employees to perform at a higher and happier level.Employee engagement must be your critical business objective if you want organizational agility, ongoing profitability and performance, customer satisfaction, and fulfilled team members.As a best-selling author, consultant, and coach for over 15 years, I have worked with organizations of all sizes around the world to improve the engagement and productivity of their teams and the efficacy of their leadership.

Apologies for sharing another right leaning media outlet, I've got no idea what the quality left leaning media is up to, but great harm is happening on the watch of Editors and journalists who've long cared about society and fairness and who somehow can't see things differently  To be clear, I've NEVER thought Covid has been: - Not a significant danger  - A conspiracy It's just been very clear from the data that the cure is far far far worse than the disease, but in ways that are less attributable and happen over a longer horizon.

My third company (video storytelling, personal branding, and signature experiences) found a lot of success before we decided to close down amidst Covid-19.There were a lot of ups & downs throughout 2016-2021:▶ Power being turned off.▶ Sleeping on my office floor.▶ Pushing myself to speak: TEDx talk, INBOUND, VidCon, and over 50 other events.▶ Launching a podcast that hit top 50 on day one — Stupid Deep.▶ Building a company with some of my best friends — and being able to employ 10 others full-time.▶ And I could go on and on and on.My little brother passed away in 2019. Going through that, COVID, and everything else going on in our world I knew that I needed something new. I interviewed Lewis Howes on my podcast. A handful of months later I joined his team at Greatness Media as the marketing lead. That’s where I’m at now and I’m enjoying every second of it. Collectively my videos, thoughts, podcasts, and writing have been viewed over 15 million times.How I can help you:✔️ Podcast Sponsorship: My show Stupid Deep is a cinematic podcast. It’s grown quickly and I’m not slowing down anytime soon.✔️ Personal Branding consulting: Growth, strategy, LinkedIn, content strategy, etc. I only work with 10 personal branding clients a year. 😊✔️ Speaking at your event: I’ve done talks at INBOUND, VidCon, TEDx, and more.✔️ Esports — one of my main passions is esports (and just gaming overall). I will be helping endemic & non-endemic brands via connections, sponsorships, and branding/personal branding.Feel free to reach out to me here, via email, or you can learn more about me on my website: quentinallums.com",1 year ago,"Super excited!

In an uncertain world, strong employee engagement will future-proof your company. Last year showed the business world how easily our goals, visions, and profitability can radically change. The way we work has changed. Forever. And that’s a good thing because it gives us an opportunity to re-engage with HOW and WHY our employees work. Consider this:• 72% of workers surveyed by the World Economic Forum want a hybrid remote-office model;• 64% of the U.S. workforce is disengaged;• 69% of employees are experiencing burnout symptoms while working from home; and• Almost 9 in 10 (89%) US workers have experienced burnout in the last yearYour team works from home now, in some capacity. And while your workforce may want a hybrid-office work model now and for the future, they are experiencing higher-than-ever levels of burnout. Burnout leads to disengagement, and disengaged workforces underperform. Now is the time to transition, support, empower, and inspire your employees to perform at a higher and happier level.Employee engagement must be your critical business objective if you want organizational agility, ongoing profitability and performance, customer satisfaction, and fulfilled team members.As a best-selling author, consultant, and coach for over 15 years, I have worked with organizations of all sizes around the world to improve the engagement and productivity of their teams and the efficacy of their leadership. I equip, empower, and inspire them to:• Develop their managers as both engagers of their people and keepers of the culture • Address remote culture breakdowns and “death by Zoom”• Elevate performance and productivity to work smarter in a remote world• Connect individual contributors to organizational goals and hold them accountable for results• Empower their managers to lead agile, high-performance, hybrid teams• Streamline communication channel overwhelm and tame their inboxMy clients have had these results…$2 million in additional revenue per year• ""Our total sales calls per week are up over 20% from the prior year.

In an uncertain world, strong employee engagement will future-proof your company. Last year showed the business world how easily our goals, visions, and profitability can radically change. The way we work has changed. Forever. And that’s a good thing because it gives us an opportunity to re-engage with HOW and WHY our employees work. Consider this:• 72% of workers surveyed by the World Economic Forum want a hybrid remote-office model;• 64% of the U.S. workforce is disengaged;• 69% of employees are experiencing burnout symptoms while working from home; and• Almost 9 in 10 (89%) US workers have experienced burnout in the last yearYour team works from home now, in some capacity. And while your workforce may want a hybrid-office work model now and for the future, they are experiencing higher-than-ever levels of burnout. Burnout leads to disengagement, and disengaged workforces underperform. Now is the time to transition, support, empower, and inspire your employees to perform at a higher and happier level.Employee engagement must be your critical business objective if you want organizational agility, ongoing profitability and performance, customer satisfaction, and fulfilled team members.As a best-selling author, consultant, and coach for over 15 years, I have worked with organizations of all sizes around the world to improve the engagement and productivity of their teams and the efficacy of their leadership. I equip, empower, and inspire them to:• Develop their managers as both engagers of their people and keepers of the culture • Address remote culture breakdowns and “death by Zoom”• Elevate performance and productivity to work smarter in a remote world• Connect individual contributors to organizational goals and hold them accountable for results• Empower their managers to lead agile, high-performance, hybrid teams• Streamline communication channel overwhelm and tame their inboxMy clients have had these results…$2 million in additional revenue per year• ""Our total sales calls per week are up over 20% from the prior year.

DM me for more info on podcast sponsorship or personal branding ⤵️,"['Milwaukee,', 'Wisconsin,', 'United', 'States']",66387.0,500+,"Hey, I'm #justQ 🖖🏽! In 2016 my friend asked to interview me about a new startup I was starting. I remember thinking to myself *OMG NO* because the thought of being on camera terrified me. For some reason, I agreed to do it anyway.It went terribly & I was so embarrassed. After that, I made a promise to myself to master the art of being on camera and ended up recording a video for +500 straight days. Eventually that lead me to LinkedIn, where I became one of the first video influencers. Long story short, my first company (a virtual reality startup) failed within months. My second company (an agency that focused on LinkedIn personal branding) found some success as I started to grow but ultimately was just me and I wanted more. My third company (video storytelling, personal branding, and signature experiences) found a lot of success before we decided to close down amidst Covid-19.There were a lot of ups & downs throughout 2016-2021:▶ Power being turned off.▶ Sleeping on my office floor.▶ Pushing myself to speak: TEDx talk, INBOUND, VidCon, and over 50 other events.▶ Launching a podcast that hit top 50 on day one — Stupid Deep.▶ Building a company with some of my best friends — and being able to employ 10 others full-time.▶ And I could go on and on and on.My little brother passed away in 2019. Going through that, COVID, and everything else going on in our world I knew that I needed something new. I interviewed Lewis Howes on my podcast. A handful of months later I joined his team at Greatness Media as the marketing lead. That’s where I’m at now and I’m enjoying every second of it. Collectively my videos, thoughts, podcasts, and writing have been viewed over 15 million times.How I can help you:✔️ Podcast Sponsorship: My show Stupid Deep is a cinematic podcast. It’s grown quickly and I’m not slowing down anytime soon.✔️ Personal Branding consulting: Growth, strategy, LinkedIn, content strategy, etc. I only work with 10 personal branding clients a year. 😊✔️ Speaking at your event: I’ve done talks at INBOUND, VidCon, TEDx, and more.✔️ Esports — one of my main passions is esports (and just gaming overall). I will be helping endemic & non-endemic brands via connections, sponsorships, and branding/personal branding.Feel free to reach out to me here, via email, or you can learn more about me on my website: quentinallums.com",2 years ago,"It's been over 730 days since I jumped into entrepreneurship full-time.

I'm still crazy humbled that someone would take the time out of their day to make something about my life (up to the beginning of 2018). Thank you again  Donovan  for sending this to me last year. Here are a few things I'm focused on accomplishing this year: - Crushing my TEDx Talk in April. - Scaling our company to 7 Figures ARR in our first 18 months. - Having  Sophia Amoruso  or  Jason Silva  on my podcast. If you can help make this happen please shoot me a message! - Making collaboration a focus again on a personal level. Feel free to tag anyone you think I should collaborate with!

In an uncertain world, strong employee engagement will future-proof your company. Last year showed the business world how easily our goals, visions, and profitability can radically change. The way we work has changed. Forever. And that’s a good thing because it gives us an opportunity to re-engage with HOW and WHY our employees work. Consider this:• 72% of workers surveyed by the World Economic Forum want a hybrid remote-office model;• 64% of the U.S. workforce is disengaged;• 69% of employees are experiencing burnout symptoms while working from home; and• Almost 9 in 10 (89%) US workers have experienced burnout in the last yearYour team works from home now, in some capacity. And while your workforce may want a hybrid-office work model now and for the future, they are experiencing higher-than-ever levels of burnout. Burnout leads to disengagement, and disengaged workforces underperform. Now is the time to transition, support, empower, and inspire your employees to perform at a higher and happier level.Employee engagement must be your critical business objective if you want organizational agility, ongoing profitability and performance, customer satisfaction, and fulfilled team members.As a best-selling author, consultant, and coach for over 15 years, I have worked with organizations of all sizes around the world to improve the engagement and productivity of their teams and the efficacy of their leadership.

The female image was done by a Native American artist. And what product had a Native American woman front and center — and not in a demeaning way?   Except ..... here’s what I recall as a teenager lo those many years ago that made me cringe and I thought that was why the image was removed.  If you bent the box (empty) a certain way, the woman’s knees became her breasts and she was sitting there with nothing covering her breasts.  Yipes.  Hadn’t the company realized that little and not so little boys were making a sexual display and a mockery of a Native American woman on their box?   Then decades later, when the image was to be removed, I thought: “Finally, someone smart knew about the knees/breasts swap and they are fixing it at ling last.”  Frankly it could have been corrected by a slight change in her clothing and she did not need to be removed. She did need to stop being the fantasy of young boys.  Back then, seeing breasts was a big deal — kind of like Playboy or Penthouse, neither of which seem needed with the Internet and the 60’s .... Was I dreaming this?  Chime in.  Why is no one mentioning it? Just google and there are stories and even demonstrations.  Why has this been ignored?  Or pushed under proverbial rug?

However, when a person regularly feels disproportionate levels of anxiety, it might become a medical disorder. Anxiety disorders form a category of mental health diagnoses that lead to excessive nervousness, fear, apprehension, and worry. Last week we began the conversation by talking about general anxiety.  Today's focus will be on Social Anxiety.  Social Anxiety is a chronic mental health condition in which social interactions cause irrational anxiety. For people with social anxiety disorder, everyday social interactions cause irrational anxiety, fear, self-consciousness, and embarrassment. Symptoms may include excess fear of situations in which one may be judged, worry about embarrassment or humiliation, or concern about offending someone. Come join in the discussion and leave your comments and questions.  The show streams live at 10 AM CST.

In 2008, I left to join two of its award-winning mobile team to found ubinow – a mobile apps studio at the dawn of the App Store age. Ubinow was acquired by Havas.I went on to co-found We Make Play – a digital studio offering advice on technical innovation at concept stage. We Make Play spun out to become The Junto Network which supports founders and innovators through community and dinners.My passion has become my career – focusing on highlighting the stories of inspiring founders and innovators. I started F = to tell women’s stories, and whilst on maternity leave, I wrote Mad Men of Mobile - a collection of one-on-one interviews with 13 mobile innovators and founders; including Siri, Shazam, AdMob, OpenFeint, ustwo and Imangi Studios.

And yet the best founders I have interviewed are deeply empathetic, often because they have had to overcome their own adversity. One such founder is the brilliant founder  David Rogier  of  MasterClass  who I had the pleasure of interviewing earlier this year. He said in his interview:  “I stutter. When I was a kid, it was bad. I was teased in school about it. My family refused to let me use it as an excuse. One day I decided to tell my grandfather that I stuttered and was being teased in school for it. He gave me a hug and said — “So? You going to let that stop you?” In his eyes, if you weren’t in Auschwitz… you’re OK. My parents would not let me use my stutter as an excuse to temper my curiosity (to not ask questions). They always expected my brother and I, from a very early age, to participate in dinner conversations with their friends. They were incredibly loving and determined for my brother and I to achieve whatever we wanted.”  https://lnkd.in/em3TwNg   #founders   #startup   #entrepreneur   #entrepreneurship   #innovation   #tech

In an uncertain world, strong employee engagement will future-proof your company. Last year showed the business world how easily our goals, visions, and profitability can radically change. The way we work has changed. Forever. And that’s a good thing because it gives us an opportunity to re-engage with HOW and WHY our employees work. Consider this:• 72% of workers surveyed by the World Economic Forum want a hybrid remote-office model;• 64% of the U.S. workforce is disengaged;• 69% of employees are experiencing burnout symptoms while working from home; and• Almost 9 in 10 (89%) US workers have experienced burnout in the last yearYour team works from home now, in some capacity. And while your workforce may want a hybrid-office work model now and for the future, they are experiencing higher-than-ever levels of burnout. Burnout leads to disengagement, and disengaged workforces underperform. Now is the time to transition, support, empower, and inspire your employees to perform at a higher and happier level.Employee engagement must be your critical business objective if you want organizational agility, ongoing profitability and performance, customer satisfaction, and fulfilled team members.As a best-selling author, consultant, and coach for over 15 years, I have worked with organizations of all sizes around the world to improve the engagement and productivity of their teams and the efficacy of their leadership.

As sales took off, Kevin moved to headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts and went on an industry consolidating acquisition binge.From 1995 to 1999 he bought out almost every one of his software competitors, including Mindscape, Broderbund and the Learning Company in the industry's first vicious public hostile battle. Shareholders loved his take-no-prisoners, cost cutting style and fueled him with billions to do his deals.In 1999 Kevin sold his company to the Mattel Toy Company for $4.2 billion, one of the largest deals ever done in the consumer software industry. To keep his money working hard, he took control of his wealth from his lackluster money managers and founded his own mutual fund company, O'Leary Funds. He raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors who share his ""get paid while you wait"" yield oriented, value investing philosophy. He shares his tips and tribulations with a national television audience and turns The Street upside down in the process.As a self-proclaimed ""Eco-preneur,"" Kevin looks hardest for investments that make money - and are environmentally friendly.

From his basement, he launched SoftKey Software Products. As sales took off, Kevin moved to headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts and went on an industry consolidating acquisition binge.From 1995 to 1999 he bought out almost every one of his software competitors, including Mindscape, Broderbund and the Learning Company in the industry's first vicious public hostile battle. Shareholders loved his take-no-prisoners, cost cutting style and fueled him with billions to do his deals.In 1999 Kevin sold his company to the Mattel Toy Company for $4.2 billion, one of the largest deals ever done in the consumer software industry. To keep his money working hard, he took control of his wealth from his lackluster money managers and founded his own mutual fund company, O'Leary Funds. He raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors who share his ""get paid while you wait"" yield oriented, value investing philosophy. He shares his tips and tribulations with a national television audience and turns The Street upside down in the process.As a self-proclaimed ""Eco-preneur,"" Kevin looks hardest for investments that make money - and are environmentally friendly. When he's not squeezing the market from his office, he travels the world looking for new opportunities to deploy his capital. He is on the investment committee of Boston's prestigious 200-year-old Hamilton Trust.He launched O’Shares ETFs, a group of exchange traded funds. He is O'Shares Chairman.",2 years ago,"When I was 7 my parents and teachers didn't think I'd ever be able to read or do basic math, because of my debilitating dyslexia. I was lucky enough to work with an amazing educator who convinced me that my dyslexia was a superpower. My confidence grew, and I realized that the problem wasn't that I couldn't learn - it was that the standardized resources and tools being thrown at me were useless.  Once I was able to understand my dyslexia, I was able to master it and use it to my advantage. The same is true for ANY weakness. Get to know yourself. Get to know your faults. Then grab them by the horns, and use them to unleash your full potential.  Interviewer:  Bryan Elliott

In an uncertain world, strong employee engagement will future-proof your company. Last year showed the business world how easily our goals, visions, and profitability can radically change. The way we work has changed. Forever. And that’s a good thing because it gives us an opportunity to re-engage with HOW and WHY our employees work. Consider this:• 72% of workers surveyed by the World Economic Forum want a hybrid remote-office model;• 64% of the U.S. workforce is disengaged;• 69% of employees are experiencing burnout symptoms while working from home; and• Almost 9 in 10 (89%) US workers have experienced burnout in the last yearYour team works from home now, in some capacity. And while your workforce may want a hybrid-office work model now and for the future, they are experiencing higher-than-ever levels of burnout. Burnout leads to disengagement, and disengaged workforces underperform. Now is the time to transition, support, empower, and inspire your employees to perform at a higher and happier level.Employee engagement must be your critical business objective if you want organizational agility, ongoing profitability and performance, customer satisfaction, and fulfilled team members.As a best-selling author, consultant, and coach for over 15 years, I have worked with organizations of all sizes around the world to improve the engagement and productivity of their teams and the efficacy of their leadership. I equip, empower, and inspire them to:• Develop their managers as both engagers of their people and keepers of the culture • Address remote culture breakdowns and “death by Zoom”• Elevate performance and productivity to work smarter in a remote world• Connect individual contributors to organizational goals and hold them accountable for results• Empower their managers to lead agile, high-performance, hybrid teams• Streamline communication channel overwhelm and tame their inboxMy clients have had these results…$2 million in additional revenue per year• ""Our total sales calls per week are up over 20% from the prior year.

Consider this:• 72% of workers surveyed by the World Economic Forum want a hybrid remote-office model;• 64% of the U.S. workforce is disengaged;• 69% of employees are experiencing burnout symptoms while working from home; and• Almost 9 in 10 (89%) US workers have experienced burnout in the last yearYour team works from home now, in some capacity. And while your workforce may want a hybrid-office work model now and for the future, they are experiencing higher-than-ever levels of burnout. Burnout leads to disengagement, and disengaged workforces underperform. Now is the time to transition, support, empower, and inspire your employees to perform at a higher and happier level.Employee engagement must be your critical business objective if you want organizational agility, ongoing profitability and performance, customer satisfaction, and fulfilled team members.As a best-selling author, consultant, and coach for over 15 years, I have worked with organizations of all sizes around the world to improve the engagement and productivity of their teams and the efficacy of their leadership. I equip, empower, and inspire them to:• Develop their managers as both engagers of their people and keepers of the culture • Address remote culture breakdowns and “death by Zoom”• Elevate performance and productivity to work smarter in a remote world• Connect individual contributors to organizational goals and hold them accountable for results• Empower their managers to lead agile, high-performance, hybrid teams• Streamline communication channel overwhelm and tame their inboxMy clients have had these results…$2 million in additional revenue per year• ""Our total sales calls per week are up over 20% from the prior year.

It helps check my resting heart rate. It has helped me improve my sleep and wake up at the best time every morning. It has helped me lost weight and then keep it. It has helped me design a preventive plan with my physicians. This is the summary of what I have learnt while using around +100 digital health technologies over the last decade. Unless you a fitness guru with a unique intrinsic motivation, you will be like me: needing external motivation. Data can bring it to you.

DM me for more info on podcast sponsorship or personal branding ⤵️,"['Milwaukee,', 'Wisconsin,', 'United', 'States']",66387.0,500+,"Hey, I'm #justQ 🖖🏽! In 2016 my friend asked to interview me about a new startup I was starting. I remember thinking to myself *OMG NO* because the thought of being on camera terrified me. For some reason, I agreed to do it anyway.It went terribly & I was so embarrassed. After that, I made a promise to myself to master the art of being on camera and ended up recording a video for +500 straight days. Eventually that lead me to LinkedIn, where I became one of the first video influencers. Long story short, my first company (a virtual reality startup) failed within months. My second company (an agency that focused on LinkedIn personal branding) found some success as I started to grow but ultimately was just me and I wanted more. My third company (video storytelling, personal branding, and signature experiences) found a lot of success before we decided to close down amidst Covid-19.There were a lot of ups & downs throughout 2016-2021:▶ Power being turned off.▶ Sleeping on my office floor.▶ Pushing myself to speak: TEDx talk, INBOUND, VidCon, and over 50 other events.▶ Launching a podcast that hit top 50 on day one — Stupid Deep.▶ Building a company with some of my best friends — and being able to employ 10 others full-time.▶ And I could go on and on and on.My little brother passed away in 2019. Going through that, COVID, and everything else going on in our world I knew that I needed something new. I interviewed Lewis Howes on my podcast. A handful of months later I joined his team at Greatness Media as the marketing lead. That’s where I’m at now and I’m enjoying every second of it. Collectively my videos, thoughts, podcasts, and writing have been viewed over 15 million times.How I can help you:✔️ Podcast Sponsorship: My show Stupid Deep is a cinematic podcast. It’s grown quickly and I’m not slowing down anytime soon.✔️ Personal Branding consulting: Growth, strategy, LinkedIn, content strategy, etc. I only work with 10 personal branding clients a year. 😊✔️ Speaking at your event: I’ve done talks at INBOUND, VidCon, TEDx, and more.✔️ Esports — one of my main passions is esports (and just gaming overall). I will be helping endemic & non-endemic brands via connections, sponsorships, and branding/personal branding.Feel free to reach out to me here, via email, or you can learn more about me on my website: quentinallums.com",2 years ago,"I never had that Father figure growing up. And I’m not saying that to be down, I’ve just never had that. As kids we looked out for one another. We did what we had to do to survive.  And for that I appreciate my dad. His absence taught us how to take care of ourselves. How to make shit happen on our own. How to survive. And I’m thankful for that. Because while we are building our new company some days I feel like I’m on top of the world. Some days I feel like I’m about to be laid out by a bus. Some days it feels like I was laid out by a bus. But it’s a survivors game. And I’ve been playing it my entire life. _ Sometimes your weaknesses turn out to be your greatest strengths. #justQ  🖤

In an uncertain world, strong employee engagement will future-proof your company. Last year showed the business world how easily our goals, visions, and profitability can radically change. The way we work has changed. Forever. And that’s a good thing because it gives us an opportunity to re-engage with HOW and WHY our employees work. Consider this:• 72% of workers surveyed by the World Economic Forum want a hybrid remote-office model;• 64% of the U.S. workforce is disengaged;• 69% of employees are experiencing burnout symptoms while working from home; and• Almost 9 in 10 (89%) US workers have experienced burnout in the last yearYour team works from home now, in some capacity. And while your workforce may want a hybrid-office work model now and for the future, they are experiencing higher-than-ever levels of burnout. Burnout leads to disengagement, and disengaged workforces underperform. Now is the time to transition, support, empower, and inspire your employees to perform at a higher and happier level.Employee engagement must be your critical business objective if you want organizational agility, ongoing profitability and performance, customer satisfaction, and fulfilled team members.As a best-selling author, consultant, and coach for over 15 years, I have worked with organizations of all sizes around the world to improve the engagement and productivity of their teams and the efficacy of their leadership.

In an uncertain world, strong employee engagement will future-proof your company. Last year showed the business world how easily our goals, visions, and profitability can radically change. The way we work has changed. Forever. And that’s a good thing because it gives us an opportunity to re-engage with HOW and WHY our employees work. Consider this:• 72% of workers surveyed by the World Economic Forum want a hybrid remote-office model;• 64% of the U.S. workforce is disengaged;• 69% of employees are experiencing burnout symptoms while working from home; and• Almost 9 in 10 (89%) US workers have experienced burnout in the last yearYour team works from home now, in some capacity. And while your workforce may want a hybrid-office work model now and for the future, they are experiencing higher-than-ever levels of burnout. Burnout leads to disengagement, and disengaged workforces underperform. Now is the time to transition, support, empower, and inspire your employees to perform at a higher and happier level.Employee engagement must be your critical business objective if you want organizational agility, ongoing profitability and performance, customer satisfaction, and fulfilled team members.As a best-selling author, consultant, and coach for over 15 years, I have worked with organizations of all sizes around the world to improve the engagement and productivity of their teams and the efficacy of their leadership. I equip, empower, and inspire them to:• Develop their managers as both engagers of their people and keepers of the culture • Address remote culture breakdowns and “death by Zoom”• Elevate performance and productivity to work smarter in a remote world• Connect individual contributors to organizational goals and hold them accountable for results• Empower their managers to lead agile, high-performance, hybrid teams• Streamline communication channel overwhelm and tame their inboxMy clients have had these results…$2 million in additional revenue per year• ""Our total sales calls per week are up over 20% from the prior year.

He is passionate about storytelling, operations, and product development. Tai deeply cares about social impact and how technology can help bridge opportunity gaps for historically marginalized communities. Through his launch of Apple’s first social content strategy, he was named a Forbes 30 Under 30 in Marketing & Advertising. Tai was recognized as the youngest LinkedIn Top Voice, alongside Bill Gates and Richard Branson. He is currently the head of marketing at Matter, a San Francisco based Saas startup dedicated to making professional feedback positive and productive. Outside of work, Tai also leads Close the Gap Foundation, a 501c3 nonprofit, with a team of twelve staff volunteers from companies like Apple, Facebook, Intuit, Deloitte, and Google.Immigrating from Vietnam to the U.S. at the age of six, Tai learned firsthand the hardship that first-generation and low-income communities face to belong and thrive. He started Close the Gap Foundation to bridge today’s widening social mobility gap. Since 2017, Close the Gap has distributed over $10,000 in school supplies and college-bound scholarships while mentoring 800+ low-income students across the U.S. Through his TEDx, Tai shared how professionals from historically marginalized communities can close the network gap by cultivating a personal brand. His TEDx has been viewed by over a quarter-million people worldwide.

It's also refreshing and inspiring to see tech brands like Visa taking the lead in furthering this cause and in the process positively shaping the future of such a deserving, yet underserved group of determined and talented students.  I entered Silicon Valley with no ties to tech—both of my parents never attended high school. Through personal branding and platforms like LinkedIn, I have been able to develop a meaningful network of mentors that has radically transformed my career and life. While low income students may not grow up being taught the importance of networking, college is the best time to change that for the better. tl;dr (too long; didn't read): Treat your personal brand as a tapestry of experiences and relationships, not a transactional tool. When done with purpose and authenticity, your personal brand will compound over time, and put you in the power position to be discovered and unlock disruptive opportunities.

If you're part of the management status quo, your days are coming to an end. Learn, once and for all, that employees matter.  #MeToo  started it.

I am concerned that we move so slowly in education that many children who could benefit from improvements are left behind.   Today, I was listening to folks chatting about 5G and its implementation hurdles.  One speaker observed that we needed to be heartened by some changes — the move away from pay phones and phone booths to cell phones.  Those phone booths are anachronistic.  One generation and they are gone.  No coin calls basically.   I wonder whether the speed of technology and its acceptance can be transportable into education.  Why not get the next generation accustomed to trauma responsive institutions with problem solving and interdisciplinary efforts?  We think of Hampshire’s reforms as innovative.  Really? Many have pondered problem focused and thematic learning for decades but fear and tradition stand in our way when implementation is at issue. Why not deploy different models for education at all levels?  Take away the educational equivalent of pay phones and booths.  What do we have to lose? We have lots to gain.

Taking an intentional step to ""close the loop""  and clarify the decisions made becomes SO important and SO appreciated.  Closing the loop is NOT only important on initiatives/people/projects you decided to move forward with, but more importantly with the ones you decided to leave behind.  I encourage you to take a step to close the loop with the right parties (teams, customers, candidates, partners) about topics such as:  - Decision to not move forward with a particular project/partner/customer - Decision to not fund company X (applies to VCs) - Hiring decision to reject a candidate (close the loop w/ candidate) - your clear goals for a particular project and its timeline Clearly closing the loop shows our respect & dedication to others and our determination to make tough calls.   #closetheloop   #bestpractices   #bestbusinesspractices   #hiringtips   #jobsearchadvice   #management   #leadership

Why spend more money bailing out another airline that should be allowed to go bankrupt and reduce its capacity when there are millions that can't get inoculated.

In an uncertain world, strong employee engagement will future-proof your company. Last year showed the business world how easily our goals, visions, and profitability can radically change. The way we work has changed. Forever. And that’s a good thing because it gives us an opportunity to re-engage with HOW and WHY our employees work. Consider this:• 72% of workers surveyed by the World Economic Forum want a hybrid remote-office model;• 64% of the U.S. workforce is disengaged;• 69% of employees are experiencing burnout symptoms while working from home; and• Almost 9 in 10 (89%) US workers have experienced burnout in the last yearYour team works from home now, in some capacity. And while your workforce may want a hybrid-office work model now and for the future, they are experiencing higher-than-ever levels of burnout. Burnout leads to disengagement, and disengaged workforces underperform. Now is the time to transition, support, empower, and inspire your employees to perform at a higher and happier level.Employee engagement must be your critical business objective if you want organizational agility, ongoing profitability and performance, customer satisfaction, and fulfilled team members.As a best-selling author, consultant, and coach for over 15 years, I have worked with organizations of all sizes around the world to improve the engagement and productivity of their teams and the efficacy of their leadership. I equip, empower, and inspire them to:• Develop their managers as both engagers of their people and keepers of the culture • Address remote culture breakdowns and “death by Zoom”• Elevate performance and productivity to work smarter in a remote world• Connect individual contributors to organizational goals and hold them accountable for results• Empower their managers to lead agile, high-performance, hybrid teams• Streamline communication channel overwhelm and tame their inboxMy clients have had these results…$2 million in additional revenue per year• ""Our total sales calls per week are up over 20% from the prior year.

In an uncertain world, strong employee engagement will future-proof your company. Last year showed the business world how easily our goals, visions, and profitability can radically change. The way we work has changed. Forever. And that’s a good thing because it gives us an opportunity to re-engage with HOW and WHY our employees work. Consider this:• 72% of workers surveyed by the World Economic Forum want a hybrid remote-office model;• 64% of the U.S. workforce is disengaged;• 69% of employees are experiencing burnout symptoms while working from home; and• Almost 9 in 10 (89%) US workers have experienced burnout in the last yearYour team works from home now, in some capacity. And while your workforce may want a hybrid-office work model now and for the future, they are experiencing higher-than-ever levels of burnout. Burnout leads to disengagement, and disengaged workforces underperform. Now is the time to transition, support, empower, and inspire your employees to perform at a higher and happier level.Employee engagement must be your critical business objective if you want organizational agility, ongoing profitability and performance, customer satisfaction, and fulfilled team members.As a best-selling author, consultant, and coach for over 15 years, I have worked with organizations of all sizes around the world to improve the engagement and productivity of their teams and the efficacy of their leadership. I equip, empower, and inspire them to:• Develop their managers as both engagers of their people and keepers of the culture • Address remote culture breakdowns and “death by Zoom”• Elevate performance and productivity to work smarter in a remote world• Connect individual contributors to organizational goals and hold them accountable for results• Empower their managers to lead agile, high-performance, hybrid teams• Streamline communication channel overwhelm and tame their inboxMy clients have had these results…$2 million in additional revenue per year• ""Our total sales calls per week are up over 20% from the prior year.

In my book, “My Health Upgraded”, I’m sharing the most exciting questions (and providing answers) about the future of medicine. In the upcoming month, I’ll share with you one question from my book each week and provide a short (but sweet) answer. Question 4: Is Printing Out Medical Equipment Cheaper Than Manufacturing?  In short: YES. And not only that, it’s much more customizable. 3D printing works by additive manufacturing, which means that a digital model is created of the object we want to print out, and the machine adds each layer one at a time. That way, a personalized, 3D printed cast could get ready in 2 minutes and would cost around $50.  Wealthy companies will turn to 3D printing because of its potential for total customization. Companies in poorer regions will turn to it because it makes prototypes inexpensively.

In an uncertain world, strong employee engagement will future-proof your company. Last year showed the business world how easily our goals, visions, and profitability can radically change. The way we work has changed. Forever. And that’s a good thing because it gives us an opportunity to re-engage with HOW and WHY our employees work. Consider this:• 72% of workers surveyed by the World Economic Forum want a hybrid remote-office model;• 64% of the U.S. workforce is disengaged;• 69% of employees are experiencing burnout symptoms while working from home; and• Almost 9 in 10 (89%) US workers have experienced burnout in the last yearYour team works from home now, in some capacity. And while your workforce may want a hybrid-office work model now and for the future, they are experiencing higher-than-ever levels of burnout. Burnout leads to disengagement, and disengaged workforces underperform. Now is the time to transition, support, empower, and inspire your employees to perform at a higher and happier level.Employee engagement must be your critical business objective if you want organizational agility, ongoing profitability and performance, customer satisfaction, and fulfilled team members.As a best-selling author, consultant, and coach for over 15 years, I have worked with organizations of all sizes around the world to improve the engagement and productivity of their teams and the efficacy of their leadership.

DM me for more info on podcast sponsorship or personal branding ⤵️,"['Milwaukee,', 'Wisconsin,', 'United', 'States']",66387.0,500+,"Hey, I'm #justQ 🖖🏽! In 2016 my friend asked to interview me about a new startup I was starting. I remember thinking to myself *OMG NO* because the thought of being on camera terrified me. For some reason, I agreed to do it anyway.It went terribly & I was so embarrassed. After that, I made a promise to myself to master the art of being on camera and ended up recording a video for +500 straight days. Eventually that lead me to LinkedIn, where I became one of the first video influencers. Long story short, my first company (a virtual reality startup) failed within months. My second company (an agency that focused on LinkedIn personal branding) found some success as I started to grow but ultimately was just me and I wanted more. My third company (video storytelling, personal branding, and signature experiences) found a lot of success before we decided to close down amidst Covid-19.There were a lot of ups & downs throughout 2016-2021:▶ Power being turned off.▶ Sleeping on my office floor.▶ Pushing myself to speak: TEDx talk, INBOUND, VidCon, and over 50 other events.▶ Launching a podcast that hit top 50 on day one — Stupid Deep.▶ Building a company with some of my best friends — and being able to employ 10 others full-time.▶ And I could go on and on and on.My little brother passed away in 2019. Going through that, COVID, and everything else going on in our world I knew that I needed something new. I interviewed Lewis Howes on my podcast. A handful of months later I joined his team at Greatness Media as the marketing lead. That’s where I’m at now and I’m enjoying every second of it. Collectively my videos, thoughts, podcasts, and writing have been viewed over 15 million times.How I can help you:✔️ Podcast Sponsorship: My show Stupid Deep is a cinematic podcast. It’s grown quickly and I’m not slowing down anytime soon.✔️ Personal Branding consulting: Growth, strategy, LinkedIn, content strategy, etc. I only work with 10 personal branding clients a year. 😊✔️ Speaking at your event: I’ve done talks at INBOUND, VidCon, TEDx, and more.✔️ Esports — one of my main passions is esports (and just gaming overall). I will be helping endemic & non-endemic brands via connections, sponsorships, and branding/personal branding.Feel free to reach out to me here, via email, or you can learn more about me on my website: quentinallums.com",1 year ago,"Stories need conflict. So ask yourself, what's the conflict in your life? Over the past few years I've gotten so comfortable at opening up and sharing my past. But I'm not so great at sharing what's going on currently (because I'm always so focused on getting through it). But that's something I'm working on as I move forward.  Because conflict is a gateway to connection. It makes your story relatable. That doesn't mean that everything you share has to be about hardship. Or that you need a rags to riches story.  But trickling in the adversity that your facing (or have faced) is a great way to take your content & story to the next level. Just something to think about. #justQ  🖖🏽🖤

In 2016 my friend asked to interview me about a new startup I was starting. I remember thinking to myself *OMG NO* because the thought of being on camera terrified me. For some reason, I agreed to do it anyway.It went terribly & I was so embarrassed. After that, I made a promise to myself to master the art of being on camera and ended up recording a video for +500 straight days. Eventually that lead me to LinkedIn, where I became one of the first video influencers. Long story short, my first company (a virtual reality startup) failed within months. My second company (an agency that focused on LinkedIn personal branding) found some success as I started to grow but ultimately was just me and I wanted more. My third company (video storytelling, personal branding, and signature experiences) found a lot of success before we decided to close down amidst Covid-19.There were a lot of ups & downs throughout 2016-2021:▶ Power being turned off.▶ Sleeping on my office floor.▶ Pushing myself to speak: TEDx talk, INBOUND, VidCon, and over 50 other events.▶ Launching a podcast that hit top 50 on day one — Stupid Deep.▶ Building a company with some of my best friends — and being able to employ 10 others full-time.▶ And I could go on and on and on.My little brother passed away in 2019. Going through that, COVID, and everything else going on in our world I knew that I needed something new. I interviewed Lewis Howes on my podcast. A handful of months later I joined his team at Greatness Media as the marketing lead. That’s where I’m at now and I’m enjoying every second of it. Collectively my videos, thoughts, podcasts, and writing have been viewed over 15 million times.How I can help you:✔️ Podcast Sponsorship: My show Stupid Deep is a cinematic podcast. It’s grown quickly and I’m not slowing down anytime soon.✔️ Personal Branding consulting: Growth, strategy, LinkedIn, content strategy, etc. I only work with 10 personal branding clients a year. 😊✔️ Speaking at your event: I’ve done talks at INBOUND, VidCon, TEDx, and more.✔️ Esports — one of my main passions is esports (and just gaming overall). I will be helping endemic & non-endemic brands via connections, sponsorships, and branding/personal branding.Feel free to reach out to me here, via email, or you can learn more about me on my website: quentinallums.com",1 year ago,"🎂 I turned 26 this week. 🎂  There was a long post written out but I deleted it.

The way we work has changed. Forever. And that’s a good thing because it gives us an opportunity to re-engage with HOW and WHY our employees work. Consider this:• 72% of workers surveyed by the World Economic Forum want a hybrid remote-office model;• 64% of the U.S. workforce is disengaged;• 69% of employees are experiencing burnout symptoms while working from home; and• Almost 9 in 10 (89%) US workers have experienced burnout in the last yearYour team works from home now, in some capacity. And while your workforce may want a hybrid-office work model now and for the future, they are experiencing higher-than-ever levels of burnout. Burnout leads to disengagement, and disengaged workforces underperform. Now is the time to transition, support, empower, and inspire your employees to perform at a higher and happier level.Employee engagement must be your critical business objective if you want organizational agility, ongoing profitability and performance, customer satisfaction, and fulfilled team members.As a best-selling author, consultant, and coach for over 15 years, I have worked with organizations of all sizes around the world to improve the engagement and productivity of their teams and the efficacy of their leadership.

I just had an interview with  The Wall Street Journal  about my forecast whether there would be an NBA season this year. I concluded that I can't imagine NBA's future without digital health devices. And now this. The WNBA and NBA are teaming up with digital health companies for the coming season. They'll provide  Oura  smart rings to every team and staff member, and also supply players, coaches and staff with the MightySat fingertip pulse oximeter. This is how Christy Hedgpeth, the COO WNBA, commented on these steps: “Protecting the health of players, as well as team and league staff, is paramount. Because players and staff will have the option to access additional personal health monitoring, the use of Oura Rings will further expand the league’s comprehensive safety and testing procedures for the 2020 season”. #DigitalHealth   #COVID19   #SportsHealth   #FitnessTrackers   #HealthTracking

In an uncertain world, strong employee engagement will future-proof your company. Last year showed the business world how easily our goals, visions, and profitability can radically change. The way we work has changed. Forever. And that’s a good thing because it gives us an opportunity to re-engage with HOW and WHY our employees work. Consider this:• 72% of workers surveyed by the World Economic Forum want a hybrid remote-office model;• 64% of the U.S. workforce is disengaged;• 69% of employees are experiencing burnout symptoms while working from home; and• Almost 9 in 10 (89%) US workers have experienced burnout in the last yearYour team works from home now, in some capacity. And while your workforce may want a hybrid-office work model now and for the future, they are experiencing higher-than-ever levels of burnout. Burnout leads to disengagement, and disengaged workforces underperform.

In an uncertain world, strong employee engagement will future-proof your company. Last year showed the business world how easily our goals, visions, and profitability can radically change. The way we work has changed. Forever. And that’s a good thing because it gives us an opportunity to re-engage with HOW and WHY our employees work. Consider this:• 72% of workers surveyed by the World Economic Forum want a hybrid remote-office model;• 64% of the U.S. workforce is disengaged;• 69% of employees are experiencing burnout symptoms while working from home; and• Almost 9 in 10 (89%) US workers have experienced burnout in the last yearYour team works from home now, in some capacity. And while your workforce may want a hybrid-office work model now and for the future, they are experiencing higher-than-ever levels of burnout. Burnout leads to disengagement, and disengaged workforces underperform. Now is the time to transition, support, empower, and inspire your employees to perform at a higher and happier level.Employee engagement must be your critical business objective if you want organizational agility, ongoing profitability and performance, customer satisfaction, and fulfilled team members.As a best-selling author, consultant, and coach for over 15 years, I have worked with organizations of all sizes around the world to improve the engagement and productivity of their teams and the efficacy of their leadership. I equip, empower, and inspire them to:• Develop their managers as both engagers of their people and keepers of the culture • Address remote culture breakdowns and “death by Zoom”• Elevate performance and productivity to work smarter in a remote world• Connect individual contributors to organizational goals and hold them accountable for results• Empower their managers to lead agile, high-performance, hybrid teams• Streamline communication channel overwhelm and tame their inboxMy clients have had these results…$2 million in additional revenue per year• ""Our total sales calls per week are up over 20% from the prior year. These additional calls per week should easily translate into $2 million in additional revenue per year."" - Chris Pope, VP of Distribution, Process Management and Sales Training, Coca-Cola Consolidated13,000 labor hours saved • ""After implementing the Meeting Revolution program we eliminated redundant meetings and shortened the average length of our meetings, saving 13,000 labor hours."" - VP of PharmacovigilanceLet’s connect: carson.tate@workingsimply.com.",3 years ago,"Think carefully about each task and project and why you are willing to allocate time on your calendar for it.

A month later, Charlotte made national headlines following yet another police-related shooting death. A year later, I barely recognize the country I left in 2007. And I think a lot about what home meant to me a decade ago--and what it means now. I realize that I have spent a lot of my life and career fighting to be free, committing myself only to my career passions...writing, mentoring, communicating.  No postal code, mortgage, or relationship was strong enough to tie me down.  After a year back in America, too often I still find myself looking back over my shoulder, longing for the adventure and broadened horizons of expat life.

From his basement, he launched SoftKey Software Products. As sales took off, Kevin moved to headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts and went on an industry consolidating acquisition binge.From 1995 to 1999 he bought out almost every one of his software competitors, including Mindscape, Broderbund and the Learning Company in the industry's first vicious public hostile battle. Shareholders loved his take-no-prisoners, cost cutting style and fueled him with billions to do his deals.In 1999 Kevin sold his company to the Mattel Toy Company for $4.2 billion, one of the largest deals ever done in the consumer software industry. To keep his money working hard, he took control of his wealth from his lackluster money managers and founded his own mutual fund company, O'Leary Funds. He raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors who share his ""get paid while you wait"" yield oriented, value investing philosophy. He shares his tips and tribulations with a national television audience and turns The Street upside down in the process.As a self-proclaimed ""Eco-preneur,"" Kevin looks hardest for investments that make money - and are environmentally friendly. When he's not squeezing the market from his office, he travels the world looking for new opportunities to deploy his capital. He is on the investment committee of Boston's prestigious 200-year-old Hamilton Trust.He launched O’Shares ETFs, a group of exchange traded funds.

Consistently generate high quality, original content, but do it across the right channels with the right messages for the right audience. As the chief storyteller for my organization, I take great pleasure in creating compelling, brand conscious content strategies to help my partners: generate leads, convert customers or increase awareness or engagement around their products and services. My ability to build authentic, digital narratives that capture market share and today's number one currency — attention — is not only extremely valuable for my executive partners, it's something I thoroughly enjoy. For me, strategic communications is fun as well as valuable. I welcome the opportunities I've enjoyed to work in tandem with leaders across verticals to convey a unified message inside and outside an organization. At the end of the day, no matter what form they take, communications should holistically advance a distinct brand that unifies an organization's mission, goals, aspirations, and talent.As a journalist, I've conducted thousands of interviews with leaders in almost every industry there is. As an editor I've led B2B magazine launches and produced celebrated monthly print and digital publications with tens of thousands of global readers. I know how to craft and package a compelling story, how to develop a message that will attract attention and how to use content to persuade someone to heed a call to action. And if things go astray, I know how to leverage those same tools to realign a damaged reputation and emerge stronger than ever.I've attracted tens of thousands of followers to my award-winning blog A Life Not Grey. I know how to communicate with people about controversial subject matter in ways they can understand and relate to.
