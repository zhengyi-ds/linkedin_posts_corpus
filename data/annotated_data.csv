I know many people reading this have already invested and they see the returns first hand every day.  Love to hear your experience.  For those considering taking on an apprentice or starting a program - here is some compelling reasons to give it a go... Firstly, an apprenticeship  program is one of the best investments a firm can make - U.S. Department of Labor statistics show that companies with apprenticeship programs earnt a return on investment of $1.46 for each dollar invested.  That is an average - in some sectors the ROI has been estimated at as much as $11 for every dollar invested !   Apprenticeship programs also provide employers with opportunities to improve workplace productivity, improve workforce diversity and build a pipeline of workers with the precise skills needed in your workplace (now and into the future). They can help shape the employee to your workplace culture and can strengthen your brand as an employer of choice; and finally boost employee retention.   #apprenticeship Watch:

In a sense, the second ""surge"" feels, at least to some of us, worse than the first surge; the numbers are perilously high; we have a dysfunctional transition of power (whatever your political persuasion) that is harming our nation. Some of us have become more isolated than perhaps even necessary due to fear as others flaunt mandates and best practices.   In a sense, we are unaccustomed and unprepared for what is happening in our nation.  We can rightly ask: how do we move forward with grace and wisdom and perspective?  What compensatory mechanisms can we deploy to help all those who need help? And, what about our children and their ability to navigate forward?   I have one thought: I have hope.  I still believe despite some evidence to the contrary that people are decent and caring and at the end of the day, the better side of humanity and the wiser voices will rise to the top and be seen and heard.

I just read the stories about the predator/ cult leader Larry Ray and his involvement with students at Sarah Lawrence College (including his own daughter).  It took a while but he was just arrested (later than necessary). The NYMagazine piece is chilling. My questions do not relate to the power of a cult figure on young people.  We have many examples of this... sadly. Here’s what I don’t get:  where were the Sarah Lawrence administrators and staff? Apparently, at least one knew something was “up” in a specific dorm and did not address the issues.  Perhaps a parent can spend a night or two or three in a dorm but Larry Ray’s stay appears to be much longer.  Didn’t folks notice?  Wasn’t there an RA?  I frankly am hard pressed to believe the College could claim to be so hands off or ignorant or accepting of parents living on campus. Weren’t red lights flashing? Lives and relationships were ruined.  What responsibility did/does Sarah Lawrence have and are the personnel then there  still employed?  Years in question seem to be 2010 — 2014.

I have been struck by the no-bid Cerner contract with the VA to move to electronic health records which is estimated to cost $16 billion.  No typo.  See:  https://lnkd.in/e-bR3RW .   So, here's my question: What can you get for $16 billion if we had other spending priorities?  What disease could we cure for that amount?  Could we have universal early childhood education for that amount?  We have legislation with mandates that are unfunded; suppose we looked at some of those to fund?  A recent NY Times piece noted the proliferation of child pornography on the web and the absence of sufficient resources allocated to stomping out this problem. The legislation exists; the dollars don't. Bottom line: How can a private company get a $16 billion no bid contract when we have so many other needs?   Ask yourself: What can $16 billion buy?

448,88720.0,500+,1 year ago,[],image,0,0,[],9,1,,"I just read an article in InsideHigherEd about the 15 new incoming students at Hampshire College. IHE referenced a Boston Globe article describing the feelings of these students and those who chose to attend elsewhere.   Because Hampshire is struggling, they limited 1st yr enrollment.  And of those accepted, only 15 students deposited.  Reflecting on small entry classes, why is  it necessarily a bad idea to be one of those students and for some, it cld be beneficial. Start w/ this: the students know the institution is struggling. They chose to go to an institution that is free spirited and now working to solve fiscal issues.   Might that be like an adventure for some? A bonding experience?  Being a part of something bigger?  Pursuing new pathway in higher ed?  Isn’t that the Hampshire way?  Anti-complacency?  Yes, it might be a costly student experiment—financially and otherwise. But, this is not pro forma college with consistency; this is like an entrepreneur’s start up.  I raise this because I’m still struggling to save a small college that wld clearly need a soft reboot. I don’t think all students wld avoid that. Some might like the effort, energy, commitment. Just saying: small entry classes aren’t all bad. These 15 students are bold and brave.  Bravo/brava. Rainbows.

We have shootings in an elementary school. Same outcome. We have shootings at a concert venue. Same outcome. We have shootings in churches (most recently in Texas). Same outcome.  We have shootings on campuses.  Same outcome.   Safe places -- work, worship, schools -- are now unsafe. Why aren't we doing anything about guns and gun violence?  Last time I checked, these guns were used to kill innocent people, not animals in the wild and not for self-protection.  Without some change, we will not see change in the violence is protected places. What kind of world is that? Oh, we blame mental illness.  Perhaps there has been mental diminution in those who have been the shooters. But, isn't there a link between access to weapons (their purchase and continued use) and gun violence? Might it be time to reconsider--finally --quality background checks, limits on numbers of purchases and a national database that works. What will it take? Post being shot, even Rep. Scalise was not against guns.

My comment follows link:  https://lnkd.in/dTZf4wG I am struck by the total focus on mentoring for women; this is important to be sure and it is not new. What is striking is that there is almost no mention of institutional culture and the need to change that. How important is it to create an environment in which women can thrive as leaders. Were I to institute a look-see at Princeton, I would look at culture first -- what is it in the culture that enables men to seek and thrive in leadership posts. Hard to look inward and admit that there may be cultural biases and impacts and auras. Hard to face a male dominated past and current culture. Hard to be honest about what is inhibiting success. Mentoring matters for real. But, it is not enough. No indeed.

We often are less than honest (if omission counts) when we write letters of recommendation.  We assume receivers of letters can read between the lines and know that we are not truly recommending someone but we are being cautious to avoid charges of defamation, libel and other legal risks.   So, posit this hypothetical: write a recommendation letter for Bill O'Reilly.  What should it say? Would all references to sexual abuse/harassment be absent from such a letter?  Ponder this conundrum; recommendation letters are commonplace.

So says the first recipient: “I can finally look forward to spending time with my family and friends in the new year after being on my own for most of the year.” That’s the feeling I want to have—joy, relief, self-respect and duty to my country.  Good behavior with mask wearing and good citizenship are normal parts of my behavior when it comes to COVID-19, and it takes effort—I’ve got my many masks on me all the time, hand sanitizer handy. I’m weighing going (and not going) to stores, movies, not hugging friend, not going into their homes and on it goes. And I’ll keep doing all of these things but it is getting harder to do—I mean who doesn’t want to have a cozy meal with friends? I trust science and medicine—over the last 150 years, modern healthcare has done more to improve our lifespan than any other factors—clean water, clean sanitation, antibiotics, vaccinations, dental health, are the cornerstone to our collective health and why we now live past the age of 50. So when my time comes to get vaccinated, I’ll put on my Sunday Best, roll-up my sleeve and proudly get injected.

It’s been a terrible year for infectious diseases (well, really only one...) and it’s wreaking havoc. Every single day, more than 150,000 of our beloved American friends and family members are getting infected. And every single day 1,200 friends and family members are dying. It’s sobering and it’s scary. But those of us that have the strength of body and mind can help reduce the fear, and help reduce the spread of this Killer (COVID-19) by showing their love and neighborliness by wearing a mask and keeping some distance—even during these times of gatherings.  (After all, a mask is just a mask...just like a broken arm needs a cast, it’s just a cast...) This article gives some great tips about how to stay safe while gathering with our friends and family, and while sharing our love and togetherness, which we all need right now!

 Studies show that they help us lower our blood pressure and deal with stress. But we don’t need studies to tell us what we know already! Dogs also help us get more exercise and spend more time in nature. They always love us and they are always happy to see us. In some ways, dogs show us what ‘goodness’ looks like in all of us too!
 
 Due to the ongoing pandemic, there has been an onslaught of negative news that can cause us to get mired in the spiral of depressing articles. However, it seems that a spike in dog adoptions during COVID-19 is one positive outcome that we can feel good about, as adoptions increased significantly in March and April. 
 
 So if you have a dog, or cat, or are thinking of adopting, make sure you have the  time--and love in your heart—to commit to them…Like they will commit to you.

Electronic Medical/Health Record (EMR/EHR) companies who want to own your data to make even more money off your pain and suffering. Finally patients will have all the information at their fingertips  to help them make timely decisions —a good first step for all of us.

Wow. Many of us who follow ‘deep learning’ and AI markets have seen this in radiological images (X-rays), and now there is evidence that machine-based data accumulation can ‘crunch’ and analyze information to provide better diagnoses than a doctor who has seen hundreds (or thousands) of patients with a similar disease or problem.  Think of what this can do to bring more reliable diagnoses to patients and, think about how such technologies can help patients in under-resourced areas get diagnosed and treated sooner. Talk about Democratizing health care! This is a huge leap forward for Public Health. Now....how do we get Humans to trust Machines?? Selected Excerpt: “""Machines... can have a massive impact on problems in healthcare, big and small, but unless we can convince clinicians and the public of its safety and ability then it won't be much use to anybody..”

And there is probably more displacement than just doctor's visits—now Alexa can tell if your breathing is raspy due to a cold or pneumonia! It can tell if your child is autistic, it can be your post-hospital ‘visiting nurse,’ it can order your medicines when you are running low...it can comfort lonely seniors and let kids with cancer talk to other kids with cancer about their medical journey. Ok—it can’t do all this...yet...but very, very soon. And all these medical capabilities are accomplished via AI and machine learning systems--and whether it is to differentiate cardiac pain from indigestion these home monitoring devices are providing to be highly accurate—more than doctors would be. So, welcome your new Doctor/Nurse Alexa. Selected Excerpt: “These devices correctly identified agonal breathing in 97% of instances, while registering a false positive only 0.2% of the time...Alexa could send vitals to a doctor’s office before you head to your appointment and continue to monitor your condition after you get home.”

(According to many sources, the cost of insulin has tripled in the last three years costing patients $6,000.00 per year!) Bad News: This is still really expensive for a lot of people —that’s $1,200.00 per year! Especially since over 100 million Americans have diabetes!  Good News: Even though you have to be a resident of Colorado to benefit from this cap, it’s a strong start and a model for all other states. Let’s hear it for common sense and great legislation.

While riding public transit today I ran across this elderly man who was displaying clear signs of dementia and appeared disheveled. He posed no risk to himself or others. Not sure if he was on his way to or from somewhere. Not sure if anyone wondered when he’d arrive or worried if he didn’t show up.  He seemed utterly alone, which seems painful given his senior years and confused state. Maybe we don’t (collectively) care...but somehow it struck a sad cord in my heart as I watched him point to no one and talk to no one. At one point in time, he was someone’s child and might be someone’s father. Where are people like this supposed to live? Who is supposed to help them. Where is our humanity—and even absent that—where is our infrastructure which should exist in a democratic society which holds that all people are created equal and deserves compassion?

No problem as long as they have cash. The Farm Bureau  will be allowed to sell skimpy health care coverage while offering false hope of good quality health insurance to its members . Farm Bureau officials estimated that about 42,000 people would eventually take its coverage and promised lower rates than plans complying with federal mandates. They believed the takers would be individuals without coverage or struggling to pay for individual coverage. I hope that ‘life on the farm’ is as healthy as it sounds since the new insurance coverage might not pan out the way it’s been sold to the farming community. Selected Excerpt: “...The Farm Bureau would be able to set higher rates or reject coverage for people who have pre-existing medical conditions. They also suggested that coverage could be limited for large expenses, such as a pregnancy or cancer treatment.”

And he was very irked and cranky.  Every day people break bones, sprain ankles, get diagnosed with pneumonia, chicken pox, get their hip replaced and many other ailments that require people “staying put” for a week or three. So what’s the best way to move past being mad or irritated or depressed during a period of injury or illness? Step one. Accept the current reality of the situation. Step two? Reframe the situation—For example if you are ‘bummed out’ you can’t play tennis for three months, think  ‘now an opportunity to read those books I’ve been wanting to read’ or to ‘learn to cook those four dishes that I’ve  just haven’t gotten around to...’ Truth is there’s lots that can be done during this ‘down time,’ so think ‘Crisis as Opportunity.’

Within these organizations you will not find ""skunk works"" or ""innovation labs"" or ""stealthy teams"" working on new approaches to patient care. In healthcare we are designed (and hire) for being slow, cautious and repetitious ... even if doing the same thing over and over leads to the same mediocre and disappointing results. Again I say ""Apple, come find me! I'm just up the road and am here to help improve care delivery for patients !""

Check out some of my picks from this year's virtual  CES 2021  event based on the collection of our friends over at  Medgadget ! The most obviously good idea: VitalSight by  OMRON Group , a system that connects an Omron blood pressure monitor and weight scale to a clinical EMR via a special wireless hub. The one that sounds too good to be true: Quantum Operation is like a smartwatch that is claimed to be able to continuously monitor glucose without needles. The one that should be on the market already: Valencell announced a calibration-free, cuffless blood pressure technology that can be used in wearables on the finger, wrist, and ear. The weirdest idea: Somno, the Sleep Robot, that contains sensors to measure your breathing and helps generate its own “breathing pattern” that your body will mimic to help fall asleep faster. #CES   #wearables   #healthgadgets   #themedicalfuturist   #digitalhealth   #future   #healthcare   #medicine   #technology

Tailored Regulatory Framework My take: As the draft guidance about this with details will come out this year, I hope adaptive algorithms will be covered. 2. Good Machine Learning Practice My take: The FDA wants to harmonize such practices across a range of international organizations. I'm not sure it’s possible, since their detailed plan is still not ready. 3. Patient-Centered Approach My take: I would’ve expected the digital health arm of the FDA to appoint a patient engagement advisory board, as promoting a patient centric approach without actively involving patients sounds like a risky business. 4. Regulatory Science Methods Related to Algorithm Bias & Robustness My take: This is why we expected that the FDA would take over our open access database of A.I.-based medical devices that we published in Nature Publishing Group's npj Digital Medicine paper. However, they confirmed to me that they won’t. 5. Real-World Performance  My take: The FDA should promote the importance of prospective studies when it comes to analyzing algorithms' performance in medical tasks.

Look at this: In some cases, patients need injections with an iodine-based dye (radiocontrast) to make their organs more visible in scans. But some patients can’t take the dye. So researchers developed a GAN (generative adversarial network) that generates labeled, undyed CT images of lesions on kidneys, spleens, and livers. They added these images to real-world training data to improve performance of a segmentation model that marks lesions in diagnostic scans. As it's really hard to get enough quality medical data to train the algorithm on and labeled medical data is even harder to find, GANs are making it easier and less expensive to create large, annotated datasets for training A.I. diagnostic tools.   #artificialintelligence   #ai   #aihealthcare   #digitalhealth   #futureofhealthcare   #themedicalfuturist

This time, we decided to try to tackle the beast: the issue of privacy in the digital health era. While the e-book focuses on practical recommendations and examples about YOUR privacy, it presents details on three levels: 1. Healthcare institutions holding on to your data (your medical records) 2. Medical data stored in the technologies you use (from fitness trackers to genetic tests) 3. Medical data stored where you aren’t aware of (from A.I. to the cloud) These three levels should be at the forefront of every privacy discussion going forward. They encompass the traditional, the new and the future spheres where our data is and will increasingly be stored. I truly hope you will find this e-book useful and I look forward to your feedback so we can keep on expanding it. #ebook   #privacy   #digitalhealth   #medicaldata   #healthcare   #futureofhealthcare   #healthtech   #themedicalfuturist

A woman staying at the Duesseldorf University Hospital died during a ransomware attack. It could be the first death directly linked to a cyberattack on a hospital. During the attack, the hospital couldn’t accept emergency patients and the woman was sent to a healthcare facility around 20 miles away. It's going to be extremely hard to catch these bad actors. What healthcare institutions can do is to prepare for such attacks by upgrading their cybersecurity systems.  I wonder how many hospitals worldwide employ cybersecurity experts. #themedicalfuturist   #digitalhealth   #future   #healthcare   #cybersecurity

Many thanks for that!  A bit of a context: it's not surprising that by September in 2019, there are already more medical studies mentioning machine or deep learning than in 2018.  It was also expected that oncology, pathology and radiology stand out when it comes to using A.I. methods in medicine. However, I was surprised to see so many studies in psychiatry, surgery and neurology while you don't see discussions, news and announcements about those developments often. At the same time, it seems that cardiology, ophthalmology and dermatology, the specialties with the most exciting news and developments seem to be underrepresented. The explanation could lie in the method I used to mine the database but it's still interesting.

It was interesting to learn that the developers are not professional chess players and they don't even need to be to develop such an algorithm.  Imagine the same in medicine. Developers creating the highest rated medical algorithm without having a profound knowledge of medicine. This is the era artificial intelligence is bringing to us. Here is how they described the algorithm works: ""Leela Chess uses a neural network trained without human knowledge. The training procedure uses reinforcement learning to train the next generation of the network based on games played using the previous one against itself (“self-play”) so without any external influence. The initial network is trained using random games so there is no human input in the process. The next network improvement comes from using a (small) search tree to improve the neural network’s evaluation of a position and using this outcome, together with the game result, to train the next network. Any principles used during play are discovered this way, but not in a way that can be easily extracted as such. Obviously, the rules of chess are hard-coded in the engine.""

Besides many disruptive technologies, AI has the biggest potential to support this transition by analyzing the vast amounts of data patients and healthcare institutions record in every moment.  By taking away the repetitive parts of a physician’s job, it might lead to being able to spend more precious time with their patients, improving the human touch. However, AI can only fulfill its mission if it remains a safe, efficient, and proven aid in treating patients and improving healthcare."" https://lnkd.in/gRGWDxt #themedicalfuturist   #digitalhealth   #future   #healthcare   #medicine   #technology   #TMFI   #research

One of the best questions I received was about liability. Who is to blame if an A.I. algorithm makes a mistake? This is a recurring issue and I like to answer it with a metaphor. If a physician listens to your heart sounds with a stethoscope and there was something wrong with the device and it misled the diagnosis, who is to blame? The manufacturer of the stethoscope? Never. The physician is supposed to be using all the available technologies at their disposal and with their expertise and knowledge therefore only they can be blamed, the final decision is their responsibility.  The same applies to the use of A.I. It is a (regulated, supervised and assessed) tool in the physician's hand and thus only contributes to the decisions, not making them.

You send out junior doctors to rural regions without any major experience. This is where artificial or augmented intelligence can jump in.  A Chinese company, RXThinking, is training medical algorithms to become super-diagnostician that can be dispatched to all corners of China. Instead of replacing physicians with algorithms, RXThinking's A.I.-based diagnosis app empowers them because it acts like a navigation app for the diagnostic process, drawing on all available knowledge to recommend the best route but still letting the physicians control the decision-making process. Just one example how and why A.I. is crucial for solving healthcare's global issues. #themedicalfuturist   #digitalhealth   #future   #healthcare   #medicine   #technology   #AI   #artificialintelligence   #chess   #deeplearning   #machinelearning

When speaking in front of a C-level audience I have to address the big picture, help them question their current assumptions and enhance their approaches to change from exploring new possibilities to implementing structured change. Talking to medical professionals I have to translate digital health trends into practical knowledge/advice from evaluating and implementing health sensors and trackers in their practice, to addressing privacy questions or unlocking the value of genetic testing in precision medicine/ in daily care. This “zooming” between perspectives, embracing multiple layers of a trend is what thrills me the most about these meetings. I learn something new with each encounter.

GM Garry Kasparov introduced the concept of advanced chess, also known as cyborg or centaur chess. He wanted to bring together human and computer skills to achieve the following results: - increasing the level of play to heights never before seen in chess; - producing blunder-free games with the qualities and the beauty of both perfect tactical play and highly meaningful strategic plans; - offering the public an overview of the mental processes of strong human chess players and powerful chess computers, and the combination of their forces. The most exciting medical studies that used machine or deep learning did not conclude that algorithms are better than physicians at doing a specific task but those that showed how the combination of computational and human cognition leads to the best results.  My favorite studies in this are the ones with detecting breast cancer on slides and diabetic retinopathy on retinal images. Excellent results underscoring the notion that artificial narrow intelligence will work with medical professionals and vice versa for the best results.

When I get an invitation to give a keynote, I paykage my vision about the future of healthcare and our research we do at The Medical Futurist Institute into spectacular narratives. While it takes months and a dedicated team to turn abstract thoughts into a digestible narrative, I choose to do it because people can relate to stories better than to predictions. My experience is that the better the keynote narrative is, the more challenging questions I receive.

We have also looked into new opportunities on the horizon such as cross-border cooperation or genomics on the blockchain. We believe it is important to recognize their individual potential and to find strategic opportunities, but one of the most pressing challenges that healthcare professionals and health teach leaders are facing is how to harness the value these trends can deliver collectively.

The patient also told me about how she googled her symptoms but couldn’t find any reasonable explanation. She was happy about the badge because she has mixed experiences of googling and interpreting it to healthcare practitioners. I think it’s a great possibility to get closer to younger generations because she felt safe and understood, so she won’t be hesitating next time she has any problem”.

With the people who worked so hard to be “governor” or “Senator” or “president”. I think it was because I was insecure. I didn’t want to be just me. I wanted people to like me, to maybe even VOTE for me. At age 12. When my friends were starting to hold hands with girls and feel that first unusual stirrings of romance, I would go home every day and call Senators and Governors and Presidential candidates for hours. I would write letters to them, maybe 50 letters a day, and steal the stamps from my parents. . . . . #lifestyle #politics #democrate #entrepreneur #writing

You get one, then your friends get the same one (else, according to the rules of groupthink they are no longer friends) and so on.  I hate opinions. There always seems to be someone smarter than me who has the opposite opinion.  But I'm skeptical. And I like to know things. And think. And learn. And study. AND be entertained. And laugh.  I'm launching a new podcast soon with my friend and bestselling author, AJ Jacobs called ""GOOD or BAD"". We take topics: Dogs, Monogamy, Cars, Government, Billionaires, Tipping, Democracy, Cosmetic surgery, etc and argue:  ""Is this good or bad?""  Sometimes we have a conclusion. Sometimes not.  Here is a teaser for one of the episodes: GOOD or BAD: Monogamy.  If you have suggestions for ""good or bad"" topics, please let me know in the comments.  Or, if you have opinions on monogamy, leave them in comments and I hope we read out some comments in the episode.  Enjoy! #podcast   #monogamy   #dating   #polyamory   #podcast   #opinions

Make a “chuck-it” list of things you’ll never do; go on and hike in order to let go of old grudges; communicate your gratitude through haiku. Embark on collective action to reduce your carbon footprint; luxuriate in chocolate facials to rebuke conventional beauty standards; discover your inner child by puzzling over an “ages eight and up” toykit; or host a “Dinner of Truth” and lovingly confront your most annoying traits. In an era of individualism and isolation, Acts of Friendship is a powerful guide to unity and empathy, reminding us that only through deepening our bonds with both the people and the world around us can we arrive at lasting fulfillment  #actsoffriendship   #workplacewellbeing  .

But many who worked with the famous founder had a love/hate relationship with their boss. Yes, he was inspiring and innovative. But he could also be overbearing, impatient, arrogant. In fact, it was those latter traits that led to Jobs infamously leaving Apple back in 1985, as Jobs and Apple's board simply couldn't see eye to eye. In the eyes of many, Jobs was a ""brilliant jerk.""

One line that stuck out to me more than all the rest: ""My own time and thinking is now wholly focused on COVID-19 and on how Amazon can best play its role."" Take a moment to let that sink in: Time and again, Bezos has emphasized that Amazon's strategy is a long-term one, more concerned with continuing to evolve and diversify than with short-term goals and profit, something that investors have not always understood or appreciated.  But now, Bezos has made clear that he's entirely focused on adapting his business to a disease that no one even knew about a few months ago. So, what are the lessons for you & your business? The time for wishful thinking is over. The sooner you figure out a way to adapt to the effects of the coronavirus, the better the chance your business has to survive.

And after Musk boasted that the truck's windows were practically unbreakable, Tesla lead designer Franz von Holzhausen, um...broke them.  But fast forward a bit. Within a week, Cybertruck had won over many of its fiercest detractors. Over 250,000 people were so enamored they were willing to deposit a hundred dollars to be among its first potential owners. So, how do Musk and co. do it? How do they manage to build products that customers are dying to get their hands on? Musk revealed the answer to that question in a recent interview: ""A lot of times I think people try to make products that they think others would love but they don't love them themselves. If you don't love the product, you should not expect that others will.""

This is surprising considering the cash only motivated a 4.9 percent increase...and actually resulted in a 6.5 percent drop in productivity for the week. But even more interesting was what turned out to be the biggest motivator:  The compliment. Now, if the promise of a simple text message from the boss can increase productivity, can you imagine what real, sincere, and authentic praise would do?

You must provide evidence they're likely to respect. Remember that people differ in background, upbringing, and culture; what one person finds convincing may not work for another. That’s why you must closely examine the arguments of your conversation partner. Ask yourself: •	Who influences and inspires them?  •	What research or sources do they cite?  Next, you can seek data and expert opinions from sources they are likely to heed. (Be careful not to misquote or take information out of context, which will erode your credibility.) These efforts are time-consuming and challenging. But it’s a well-spent investment, because it allows you to present evidence in a way that’s more appealing to your partner instead of wasting time on arguments they’re never likely to consider.

I chastised a team member—we’ll call him David—for a major blunder. My point was valid, but I surely could have delivered it better. David’s response was quick and cutting:  “You know, you’re the kind of manager the rest of us hate.” Ouch. Of course, David could have been more tactful. But there was no use dwelling on that; there was value in this perspective.  So, I took a few moments to let my emotions settle, then came back to David. I asked him why he felt the way he did, and learned from his honesty. In the end, it made me a better manager—and it showed David that I wasn’t the jerk that he thought I was. That's the value of honest feedback, even if it hurts to hear: It will help you grow... If you let it.

When you equip and empower your employees to adapt and find the tools they need to be effective and efficient it is an investment in your company’s present and future profitability.  Recently I worked with the largest independent Coca-Cola distributor in the United States. Their remote sales team worked hard, nights and weekends and rarely took time off.  However, sales call volume and sales numbers were down. Morale had plummeted. Paperwork, emails, phone calls, and unmet goals were piling up. Management realized that their team members were frantically busy, but not terrifically productive.  We worked with the sales team members, managers, and the sales leadership team and boosted productivity and performance. As a result, the remote sales team's  total sales calls per week went up over 20% from the prior year, which translated into $2 million in additional revenue.  Embrace the new world of work and make an investment in your company’s long-term growth and profitability.

I found it genuinely horrifying to read the death threats (and far worse) directed at a colleague I knew to be anything but the racist she was inaccurately being portrayed as. Sarah, of course, dealt with it grace and humor telling me that at least the trolls were using a decent photo of her. The irony of course is that in her book (first published in 2015) is a seminal work outlining just how online harassment works. You should read it.  https://lnkd.in/dnbMHrq

But there's something undeniably ""Brave New World"" about it. Leaving aside the creepiness, the premise seems to be built upon the assumption that understanding the past and present is key to predicting the future. History tells us this is at best only partially true. Even if Google one day manages to harness billions of user data points to help coerce the desired behavior from both the individual and the wider population, I suspect chaos theory will kick in at some point: you cannot predict the unpredictable.

Our report suggests that by 2025, spending on luxury consumption in China will increase to 1.2 trillion RMB, in the process capturing 65% of additional global growth, and accounting for 40 percent of total global spending.

Within this mix of opportunity and uncertainty, we believe AV players (from components vendors to mobility service providers) could earn trillions in revenues in China. In the long term, China will likely emerge as the world’s largest market for autonomous vehicles. In fact, the Chinese automotive market is already adopting “mobility-as-a-service” (MaaS) at a rapid rate. For example, cars sold to provide mobility services today represent about 10 percent of China’s total cars sales, and the country’s mobility-services market has grown at double-digit rates over the past several years.

Some did it well, others simply spammed the living daylights out of those CSV files. Today, not much has changed, and yet, everything is different. Over a decade later, even with 10x more tools, the task of acquiring contacts still threatens to derail even the best laid plans - but this time, it's  #ABM  at risk.  Why can't teams find the right contacts for accounts? Why don't more demand gen pros think in an account-based way, like Sales? Are we ever going to shake our MQL-based ethos? Mark is now the head of revenue operations at Localytics, and I've asked him back for a reunion with me live this Friday at 1:00pm ET for a conversation about how things have changed in 10 years, and today, how to solve this new (but old) ABM data problem.  Live here on LinkedIn we'll dig into: - The messy yet critical task of choosing target accounts, and why less is more - How to find, and use, contact records appropriately  - The truth about working with data slingers like us See you there?

It gets across the power and scalability of the platform, does so with excellent pacing and light comedy touches, and conveys a public health message all while being positive but not cloying.  And the fact that it was made during a pandemic makes it even more impressive. Not sure if it was done by an agency or if it was done in-house, but it is extremely well done either way.

The reality is that when streaming launched, nothing about it could be considered ""great."" The streaming quality wasn’t there and the library of titles available to watch was sub-par. Which is why it was launched as a free add-on for subscribers. Also, at-launch, you could only watch via a PC. Then, eventually a Mac. But the challenge the company faced was how to tap into the TV. Smart TVs and internet-connected DVD players were not widespread. Enter gaming consoles. Why? Because the goal was to get Netflix on as many internet-connected devices as quickly as possible. And game consoles already had installed user bases in the tens of millions and their consoles were all connected to the internet. So Netflix partnered with  Microsoft  XBOX,  Sony  PS3, and, believe it or not,  Nintendo  Wii. This was a mock-up of the sticker used on XBOX360 LIVE Gold physical packaging from 2008. Note the title count (12,000) and the rarely defined free trial duration. This was before the move to a 1-month free trial. #streaming   #netflix   #microsoft   #nintendo   #sony   #ps3   #xbox   #wii   #streaminghistory   #OTT   #netflixhistory

Then on Macs. Then game consoles (XBOX 360, PS3, Wii). Then came the opportunity to be available via  Apple TV. However, despite a back and forth between  Reed Hastings  and Steve Jobs, Jobs stuck to guns - no color logos on AppleTV.  It was too big of an opportunity to let get hung up by the desire to always use a full-color logo so I had the task of trying to figure out how to best represent it with those constraints.  These were the ideas I came up with. If I remember correctly, we ended up negotiating with Apple to either the 2nd or 4th one on the right. But in looking at this again, if you take away the box on the 3rd one on the left, it bears an odd resemblance to the logo as it is today. #Apple   #AppleTV   #Netflix   #logo   #design   #SteveJobs   #NetflixHistory   #netflixlogo   #brand

Some say we're still battling, thanks to voter suppression and other tactics aimed at silencing people of color.

I know the path in my journey is paved by the sacrifices of men and women like Sanders. I'm determined her efforts won't be in vain this November.

That's when I met some of the most enthusiastic, energetic and inspiring women I will EVER meet. Many had overcome incredible odds to have the privilege of being mentored by  Edna Adan Ismail . One of the young midwives I met, Kaltoun Yasin, sent me a  Facebook  instant message today to let me know that she is participating in  Harvard University 's  summer  #globalhealth  program, and that she led a presentation on  #maternalmortality  and  #morbidity  yesterday. Kaltoun took great pride in telling the audience that Madame Edna has surpassed her original goal of training 1,000 midwives in Somaliland, and that maternal deaths have dropped significantly since the training program began. At a time when I almost dread engaging with  #socialmedia  each day, I was so grateful that Kaltoun reached out to share her fantastic news. I'm determined to counteract the toxin and negativity in this world with good news like this just as often as I can. Midwife International   Harvard T.H.

She's the reason I can spring out of bed at 5:15 am most mornings.  She helps me realize that I don't have the luxury to give up or give in. That no matter what your age or station in life is, as a woman you have a voice, and you have the right to use it. And you MUST use it. Her example teaches me that, God willing, I'll have another 20 or 30 years left to try to make a difference, to contribute something positive to this world if I work hard to stay healthy and strong. I'll be posting about some of the other amazing women on this list over the coming weeks, because these days,  #genderequality  is MY JAM!  Thanks to @Apolitical for compiling this list, drawn from over 9,000 nominations. It recognises and celebrates the hard work being done on  #genderpolicy  by so many around the world.  #genderequity   #womenandgirls   #womensrights   #humanrights   #reproductivehealth   #reproductivejustice

I've been going to the meetings for close to a decade now, and this year's version looked and felt different. Job interviews (the conference doubles as a giant hiring fair) moved out of hotel rooms, where female candidates have long felt uncomfortable. There was an ombudsperson holding office hours to hear about harassment and abuse. There were even lines for the ladies room. In other words: Economics has made progress in the year since its longstanding problems with sexism and racism burst into public view. Many people told me they have seen the beginnings of a culture shift. And there have also been more concrete reforms: new committees, new policies, new enforcement mechanisms. But it is still unclear whether those reforms will translate into deeper, more lasting change. And in terms of hard numbers, economics has a long way to go: Gender and racial gaps in economics are wider -- and have been more stubborn -- than in many other fields.

24664,15213.0,500+,1 year ago,[],article,0,0,[],57,2,,"TL;DR: Bravo, Microsoft. Well done!! Nine years ago, I remember having a conversation with a (now-departed) Microsoft executive about the future of Windows Phone. My take was that we would be better off monetizing Office for Mac and Android by making it available on the hundreds of millions of devices already being sold. I distinctly remember saying: ""We already own the office productivity market for Desktop, this is the easiest way to win in Mobile - right now. We can fight the hardware battle another day."" Emphatically, I was told that I was wrong, without any data to back up that assertion, other than, and I quote: ""We will kill the iPhone.""  Years later, $40+ billion wasted on Nokia, many lessons learned, we now have this: ""But Microsoft has assured CNET that it's sticking with Android and has no plans to make a Windows-based phone. The company's Chief Product Officer Panos Panay was so emphatic about that fact, he told Wired so -- twice"" What a tremendous cultural change by Microsoft. Where Steve Ballmer and many of his former leaders fanatically pushed a dying idea to the brink of despair, Satya Nadella smartly monetized Office, embraced the world's biggest phone OS, and quietly beat everyone to innovation. This is how you win.

I had the opportunity to serve and impact many people through my work, resulting in recognition as a LinkedIn Top Voice in Tech for 2019 and nominations for other accolades. Above all else, I began to take back control of my attention, my time, and my life, leading to countless memories made with my family, friends, and loved ones. Through it all, I have emerged endlessly grateful for all that I am able to do and enjoy on a daily basis. I will continue to approach my work and my relationships with the same optimism that I have in the past. 2019 has been great! I have a feeling that 2020 will be even better. To you, my digital community, I say thank you for an incredible year. Happy Holidays and Happy New Year! I’ll see you in 2020! 👋 #Indistractable   #HappyHolidays   #Gratitude   #Reflection

Unfortunately, 44% of people quit just six months after joining. These numbers are disheartening, but not overly surprising. Humans are hardwired to chase short-term rewards over long-term benefits. I have struggled with working out for as long as I can remember, so I know that dichotomy all too well. As an obese child, my mother dragged me to the gym to no avail. As a lazy teenager, I desperately joined the wrestling team and never won a match. As an adult, I have tried to prioritize fitness many times, but have failed at each attempt. This was until I found Fitbod, a great app that has helped me consistently go to the gym for over two years. Beautifully designed and with over 3M downloads, it is among the highest grossing and highest rated apps on the Apple App Store. Fitbod has been more than useful to me, but I was surprised to learn that my book, Hooked, was useful to their founders. Fitbod is  Allen Chen 's brainchild and he told me that he designed the initial prototype based on the four parts of the Hooked Model. He identified the internal trigger as not knowing what to do at the gym. Check out the link ⇒  http://bit.ly/2WsOuPM #Hooked   #InternalTrigger   #Indistractable   #Fitness   #Fitbod

And yet the best founders I have interviewed are deeply empathetic, often because they have had to overcome their own adversity. One such founder is the brilliant founder  David Rogier  of  MasterClass  who I had the pleasure of interviewing earlier this year. He said in his interview:  “I stutter. When I was a kid, it was bad. I was teased in school about it. My family refused to let me use it as an excuse. One day I decided to tell my grandfather that I stuttered and was being teased in school for it. He gave me a hug and said — “So? You going to let that stop you?” In his eyes, if you weren’t in Auschwitz… you’re OK. My parents would not let me use my stutter as an excuse to temper my curiosity (to not ask questions). They always expected my brother and I, from a very early age, to participate in dinner conversations with their friends. They were incredibly loving and determined for my brother and I to achieve whatever we wanted.”  https://lnkd.in/em3TwNg   #founders   #startup   #entrepreneur   #entrepreneurship   #innovation   #tech

And it’ll be worth considering tapping into the skills and expertise of senior professionals while they are at it.  I am reminded of the book ‘Outliers’ by Malcolm Gladwell where he notes that 10,000 hours is the magic number for greatness. That you need to have practiced and to have apprenticed for at least 10,000 hours before you get good at a task. In fact, senior professionals and retirees come having incubated their skills and talent for much longer than that. And, therefore, they are worth more for their experience than what their age accredits them with. Whether you engage them full-time or part-time, as a consultant or as a part of the in-house team, it’s certainly a good idea for young founders enroll the expertise of someone who’s navigated the deep waters of a formal organization and can guide them in their journey to building one.

I had a fantastic call with best selling author of ""Why Me First"" and Mindset/Performance Coach,  Kajal Khurana  from Singapore. I had to contain my laughter on-air because I've been dealing with rejection a bit more than usual. Three opportunities fell apart over the past two weeks. A rejection from a local publication for the second time. Personal health issues. And more... But at this moment when I was supposed to mentor others, I was able to recenter and digest my own advice. ⬇ Lean into the rejection and understand that there is more out there for you. Your future holds greater things and losing these opportunities makes room for even BIGGER ones! Sometimes rejection is proof that you are going OUT there and doing MORE 👉 and that's a sign of effort on its own! Be proud of how far you've come, even if it isn't where you thought you should be. Agree? 👇 #Rejection

31260,85801.0,500+,2 months ago,[],video,0,0,[],96,66,,"Join Chantel Soumis and Jason Lebowitz as they continue their focus this week on Anxiety.  Anxiety is a normal and often healthy emotion. However, when a person regularly feels disproportionate levels of anxiety, it might become a medical disorder. Anxiety disorders form a category of mental health diagnoses that lead to excessive nervousness, fear, apprehension, and worry. Last week we began the conversation by talking about general anxiety.  Today's focus will be on Social Anxiety.  Social Anxiety is a chronic mental health condition in which social interactions cause irrational anxiety. For people with social anxiety disorder, everyday social interactions cause irrational anxiety, fear, self-consciousness, and embarrassment. Symptoms may include excess fear of situations in which one may be judged, worry about embarrassment or humiliation, or concern about offending someone. Come join in the discussion and leave your comments and questions.  The show streams live at 10 AM CST.

This article from  The New York Times  is a refreshing reminder that ""guilty-pleasures"" are good for you. “A guilty pleasure is something that we enjoy, but we know we’re either not supposed to like, or that liking it says something negative about us. That negative thing often ends up being an association with categories of identity we disparage and marginalize in society.  Consider what separates sports and reality TV.  The idea of someone apologizing for watching the NBA finals sounds silly, but the implied apology when someone says, “Ugh, I know ‘The Bachelor is awful but I can’t stop watching it” is normalized.""

Early 2019, I slept on my office floor for 2 months while we got our company off the ground. ✅ My company has grown quickly. And it's been amazing. But 2019 was also a rough year. I skipped pay multiple times.  ✅ I had to walk miles to meetings because I totaled my car and didn't have enough money for Lyft. ✅ I rented out two of my apartment rooms at $500 a month each. It allowed me to live rent free a lot of 2018 while I focused on building my company. ✅ I've been called a 'n***er'. Laughed at during the first pitch event I ever went to. Friends turn into enemies. Fellow creators turn on me.  Don't become an entrepreneur because of what it looks like. This is the worst thing I've ever done in my life.  But it's also the most rewarding thing I have ever done. And I can't imagine doing anything else. I'm a business owner because of the freedom. Because it fuels my curiosity. Because it allows me to empower others.

I had no plan. And I guess long term that worked out for me.  But where I wish I could go back and reframe my thinking is this: I thought it was wrong to build something on the side.  I thought I would lose respect if I took a part-time job (even though I was struggling to keep the lights on). I looked down on people that didn’t jump all in. Which was SO naive of me.  I thought building a business was easy. Because the people I followed kind of made it look easy. One of the things I struggle with most as a creator & entrepreneur is showing the reality. I don’t show: ✅ The boring stuff. ✅ Us getting ripped apart by our business coach every week 😅😭. ✅ How much work actually goes into this. ✅ The many mistakes we make.  ✅ And I could go on and on. Thank you  Cory Savage  for prompting this thought. And thank you i.c stars for asking me to do the commencement speech this year.  2020 I want to spend more time talking about (and showing) the stuff that many of us tend to avoid.

And there are few things that illustrate the power of story better than this.👇🏽 In the 60s a Harvard Psychologist, Robert Rosenthal, approached a school in California. Basically saying, “hey, I have this test I can give your students to help you identify which students are special.” The kids were then separated into two groups “average” and “special”. A year went by and the test was incredibly accurate. The “special” group blew the other group out of the water in everything from: test scores, curiosity, happiness, etc. Even the teachers were happier. The thing is, that test was 100% bullshit and the students were chosen at random.  So 1). A good story can help sell anything. And 2). Pay attention to the narratives that you’re telling yourself. Because stories have the power to create reality. #justQ  🖖🏽🖤  #entrepreneurship   #PublicSpeaking

Here’s how to drop it: First, become more mindful of your words🧠 Scan your  #emails , texts, and messages (and better yet, read them out loud). You might be shocked to learn how often that seemingly innocuous word pops up in  #communication .  Next, determine what you want🎯 Identify if you’re looking for a status update or trying to stay on someone’s radar—as well as the urgency— so you can craft an appropriate message. Finally, substitute new, action-oriented phrases🚀 Instead of “just checking in,” which screams “this isn’t important or timely” to your intended audience, try an equally polite but far more direct approach: “I’d love to hear how the (EVENT/PROJECT) is going/went. Could you give me a quick status update by end-of-day?” Or “Yikes! If your inbox is anything like mine, messages tend to get buried. I wanted to make sure things were still in progress. Let me know if you need any help.” By removing “just” from your  #business   #writing , you’ll add more power to your words and, more importantly, improve your chances of a speedy response. #leadership   #career   #IlluminateMe

Making a positive, life-changing decision requires three steps for success: 1. Awareness When we’re unhappy, it can often feel like there’s no way out, but you always have options. The first step in making a  #choice  is the  #awareness  that you have one. At this stage, it’s not about editing yourself on what’s possible; it’s about being mindful that change starts with you and your attitude. (Note: choosing not to make a change is also a choice; if you’re not changing it, you’re choosing it.) 2. Attention with Intention Once you’ve realized that change is an internal job, consider those things within your control and how they impact—for better or worse—what you want. Bring your  #attention  to your  #intention , and ask yourself what’s the one thing you can do right now to bring you closer to your  #goals . This need not be a grandiose, sweeping gesture; the biggest change starts with a small step in a new direction. 3. Action This last step may seem obvious, but far too often, we fail to act even when we know that making a change is in our best interest. Nothing changes if nothing changes. And action begets more action, giving us the much-needed momentum to keep going, no matter how slowly we start. #leadership   #career

Here are some reminders to help you navigate a “what if” world: You can’t control what happens; you can only control how you respond.✅ No one asked for the year that 2020 has been and continues to be. Rather than ponder why this is happening and lament circumstances affecting your  #career , remember there is one thing you can control: your response. Be mindful of what you consume.🧠 “You are what you eat” doesn’t only pertain to food; the same can be said in terms of the information you consume and its effects on your mental and physical wellbeing. Be aware of the people and sources you allow into your orbit, limit your exposure to those that trigger you, and seek additional perspectives that provide a balance of encouragement and  #positivity . #Perspective  is everything.😄 Asking and answering “What if?” tends to bring out extreme anxiety. But remember, you always have two choices: the worst-case scenario where you’re paralyzed by fear or the best-case scenario where you allow yourself to imagine the possibilities and become empowered by the potential of good. #leadership   #awareness

Embrace progress over perfection Reframe failure as an opportunity to learn and take action to combat your perfectionism.   3. Build in time to reflect Slow down, stop multitasking, let your mind wander, and pay attention to what bubbles up.   4. Focus on upping your “know, like, trust” factor Share your insights, listen more, and treat people with kindness and respect.   5. Just say ‘no’ Say no if it doesn’t excite you, speak to your values, further your mission in life, or help you achieve your goals.   6. Try saying ‘yes’ Say yes to new challenges and opportunities, invite collaboration, empower and affirm others, and create an environment where it’s safe to try, fail, learn and innovate.   7. Brush up on your soft skills Use soft skills to create environments that empower and ignite teams, delight customers, and fuel sustainable growth.   8. Master time-management Do, decide, delegate or delete tasks, eliminate distractions, embrace mono-tasking, work your own rhythms, and build in breaks to recharge.   *Part 1 of 3   #career   #leadership   #progress

Here’s how:   Be intentional with your time Treat reflection as essential to your  #careerdevelopment  by scheduling time to think.   Slow down & stop multitasking It’s impossible to think deeply and carefully about your future while you’re multitasking. Slow down to find clarity among your chaos.   Eliminate distractions Up your odds for reflection success by turning off notifications, silencing your phone, and closing down tabs.   Get up & out(side) Research says walks in nature enhance brain function, reduce stress, keep you energized, and improve creativity, which enables better reflection.   Allow your mind to wander During reflection, try not to limit yourself to predetermined topics, or impose any rigid standards.   Pay attention to what bubbles up Use your self-awareness to pay attention to how you’re feeling, your reactions, and any new ideas that arise during reflection.   Record & review your thoughts so you can take action Until you capture your thoughts and goals, you’ll never be able to devise a plan of action to achieve them.   #leadership

It opens you up to new challenges and opportunities. If you wait until you feel ready to pursue an opportunity, chances are it’ll pass you by. Saying yes means that you’re open to moving past your comfort zone and embracing a new challenge.  2. It invites collaboration. There’s a reason improvisation is rooted in the phrase, “Yes, and...” Unlike no, which shuts down conversations and progress, saying yes opens up positive possibilities and invites others to build together, fostering collaboration, partnership, and further discussion. 3. It empowers and affirms others. As a leader, choosing to say yes acts as an affirmation to others and their ideas: I hear what you just said. You’re paying attention, and they matter. And giving the green light signals trust, which empowers others. 4. It creates an environment where it’s safe to try, fail, learn, and innovate. When you freely say yes, you create a risk-tolerant environment. You encourage innovation by trying new things and using the successes and failures as learning opportunities. 5. It makes life more fun. Saying yes can bring you new sources of joy and lead you on an incredible adventure. #leadership   #career   #growth

If you only use your content to sell, you’ll turn people off. Instead, strive to be of service.   If you go on and on, meandering your way through a very long post with little punctuation, run-on sentences, and no clear point, you’ll lose people.   If a reader takes the time to like, comment, and share your stuff, make sure to acknowledge their kindness.   And on that note, be sure to like, comment and share other people’s content that you think your network would find valuable. If it resonated with you, it probably will with others.   The best way to discover interesting and valuable content is to read — a lot.   Follow people whose writing you admire, whether in your industry or not, and seek many sources of information, even if it makes you uncomfortable. You never know what you’ll learn and from whom. Be open.   Content can inform, entertain, persuade, or inspire. Choose wisely.   Be yourself. Write the way you speak.   And be consistent — in your creation, your voice, your sharing, your engagement.   Because my biggest takeaway is this:  Content may be king, but content comes from people. And people connect with people.

Simon Sinek  believes it's the most important instrument in a leader's toolbox. And  Oprah Winfrey  cites it as fundamental to leadership. The secret of their success is something that might surprise you: EMPATHY. This soft skill is often misunderstood and confused with its cousin, sympathy, which is feeling compassion for somebody.   But empathy is about putting yourself in someone else’s shoes and seeing things from their perspective.   How can YOU be more a more empathetic leader?   First, shift your mindset to put people first. See them as human beings rather than a means to the end of a transaction or task.   Next, ask thoughtful and probing questions that draw out implications and feelings.   Finally, use your awareness to give others your full attention and truly listen to what matters most to them.   When you do these things, you’ll better understand your customers, colleagues, and partners, and then be able to use those insights in ways to better serve and communicate with them.   And in this way, empathy can give you an edge as a leader—and as a human being.   #empathy   #leadership   #business   #success   #relationships   #communication   #growth   #softskills   #career   #HumansFirst   #growthmindset

What’s astounding is how pervasive it is. In this week’s episode of A Bit of Optimism, we talked about what ethical fading is and what we can do about it. Listen wherever you get your podcasts or at  apple.co/simonsinek.

Time, energy, missed opportunities and sometimes our lives. Some call this sacrifice. But not those who serve. For them, it was no sacrifice at all. It was a gift worth giving. Gen Stan McChrystal, author of Team of Teams, has a particular fondness for those who give quietly. No broadcast. No bragging. To him, true service includes humility.

When we find the courage to admit that we're struggling, ask for help or accept help when it is offered, we become stronger. It also opens a door for others to let us in to help them, too. The courage to go first then be there when others follow is what leadership is all about.
